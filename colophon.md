intro: "It's a tough business, getting your music in front of reviewers. I know, I've tried it myself and had both good and bad responses and, inevitably, far more cases of no-response-at-all than either of the former."

I've always been interested in design, and so when I finally got around to migrating this blog from **[worpress.com](http://wordpress.com/)** to a self-hosted **[wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/)** installation I saw it as an opportunity to have some fun. In the four years this blog lived on wordpress.com the styling of the blog was handled by the **[Connections](http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/connections/)** theme, and I never had any complaints; it was an elegant solution with a nice colour palette and a robust and reliable blogging framework. Now, for better or worse, I'm in complete control.

## Fonts Used:

Headings are set in majesticÂ **[Bodoni](http://www.p22.com/Lanston/bodoni.html)**, while the body text is handled by the always-reliable **[Meta](http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/ff_meta_sans_ff_meta_serif/)**. I experimented with a whole lot of typefaces for the body, but what eventually swung it for me was the fantastic cross-browser consistency of **meta** (designed by everyone's favourite type-god **[erik spiekermann](http://spiekermann.com/en/)**), it's excellent web hinting (something the other otherwise perfect fonts I tested lacked) and the ability to add in **small caps** (although that required a bit of **css** hackery, I'll admit).

The fonts are provided using the [fantastic **typekit** webfont service](https://typekit.com/), although if you have javascript disabled then you'll get (hopefully) the best alternative option your browser can provide.

## Theme:

As you've probably already guessed, I'm using **wordpress** as the **cms** for this blog. The styling comes from a custom theme I put together myself, built on the excellent chassis of the **[toolbox](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox)** theme.
