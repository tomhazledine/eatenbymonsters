If you ignore the nipples, this is actually rather good. Not being particularly familiar with [Ms. Palmer](http://www.amandapalmer.net/), I assumed she was just, you know, yet another breathy, girly, away-with-the-fairies singer-songwriter. Having heard this, and having made the connection between her name and the [fantastic _Map Of Tasmania_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcoreV10hI8) I heard a while back, I wish I'd jumped on the million-dollar-plus Kickstarter campaign bandwagon. The album from that massive influx of funds is called _Theatre Is Evil_, and [will get it's **UK** release through Cooking Vinyl](http://www.thecmuwebsite.com/article/palmer-to-work-with-cooking-vinyl-on-kickstarted-album-release/).

There's great typography in the video, and a great song to go with it. I guess people will call her brave and a feminist and other silly things, but inside I'm still about ten years old and find boobs scary and intimidating...

(If you haven't guessed by now, the video is a little **NSFW**).
