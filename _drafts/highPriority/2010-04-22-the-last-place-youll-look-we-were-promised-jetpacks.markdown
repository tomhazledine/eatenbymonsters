[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/wewerepromised.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/wewerepromised.jpg)I never did get around to writing a "Top 10 Albums of 2009" post, partly through design, partly through laziness.  I may still yet, owing to the fact that there are several great records from 2009 that never got so much as a passing mention on these pages, but with every passing month the chances of my actually getting around to it become ever more slender.  But just because I didn't write a post about it doesn't mean I didn't make the list (how could I not? The assigning of an arbitrary meritocracy to the world of music is pretty much my main method of appreciating said music) and sitting unassailably on that list is _[These Four Walls](http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/release.php?id=293)_, an album by scottish outfit [We Were Promised Jetpacks](http://www.myspace.com/wewerepromisedjetpacks).

This band first came to my attention via a [FatCat Records](http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/home.php) sampler CD that came free with some now-long-forgotten music magazine* back in 2008.  It was a great CD featuring, amongst many others, act such as fey folk legend [Vashti Bunyan](http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/artistInfo.php?id=98), contemporary classicist [Max Richter](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/01/16/memoryhouse-max-richter/) and EbM favourites Frightened Rabbit; a fine exemplar of the great roster of acts that FatCat have assembled.  Hidden in the depths of this compilation was a track by We Were Promised Jetpacks called, according to the sleeve notes, _Tiny Little Voices_.  This scratchy, furious little song later surfaced as _Quiet Little Voices_ on the band's 2009 debut LP, as well as getting a release as a [single](http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/release.php?id=288), and it's quite frankly marvelous.  The rest of These Four Walls was also excellent and fast became a regular feature on my stereo.

But this is not a review of that LP.

Released on the 12th of April this year, _[The Last Place You'll Look](http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/release.php?id=314)_ is a new limited-run EP by the band.  It features two songs from the LP, _Short Bursts_ and _This Is My House, This Is My Home_, alongside three new tracks.  The whole of this EP has a markedly different tone to the album; where the LP was furious and thundering this release is more measured and contemplative.  That's not to say for one minute that this EP pulls it's punches - it can slog it out with the best of them - but it's certainly softer than it's big brother, and I'm still undecided as the whether or not this is a good thing...  _These Four Walls_ felt like a spontaneous outpouring of emotion; the sheer momentum of the record was palpable, as if the band were channeling some demonic vision.  And it was that forcefulness, that clarity of vision that made the album such a favourite of mine.  While this new EP seems more willing to dwell on the softer side of things (it has piano and strings, for heaven's sake) it doesn't sound like the band have added a new dynamic to their sound, it sounds like they've shifted down a gear.  It's hard not to compare the album and EP versions of _This Is My House..._, for instance, and not feel that the EP is just a bit too slow, just a bit too soft.  The euphoric highs of the LP are not as evident on this new record.

It's not all bad news, however.  This is a very good EP, and a thoroughly engrossing twenty minutes of music.  Whilst on one hand it's less emphatic and energetic than the album, on the other it's a considerably more mature sounding record.  As well as being simply a rewarding listen, the change in textures also bodes well for the band's future efforts; they're clearly not just a one trick pony, and I await their next release with much anticipation.

**Long story short:**_ The Last Place You'll Look_ is an excellent EP, and a must-listen for any fans of We Were Promised Jetpacks.  However, it doesn't reach the lofty pinnacles of their album, so if you're new to the band I'd suggest you make this EP the _second_ place you look; hunt down the album first, then view this EP as a stirling companion piece.
