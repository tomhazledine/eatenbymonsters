One of the unexpected dilemmas presented by this whole music blogging malarkey is thus: do I just write about ‘new’ music? Or can I write about absolutely anything at all? Ultimately, of course, there's no limit to the nonsense I can spout here, but surely some sort of editorial discipline should be exercised for the sake of readability.  So, I propose an ungodly compromise: I'll limit myself to posting about stuff that's new _to me_.

Accidental discoveries and recommendations form a far greater part of my current listening time than genuinely new stuff - that's just how taste works.  Plus it can sometimes take a record a little while to be ‘broken in’.  Most of my latest favourite albums have been recommended to me by friends recently, but were actually released _ages_ ago; such as **Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers** by **The National**, circa **2003**, and [**Frightened Rabbit**'s](http://www.myspace.com/frightenedrabbit) **The Midnight Organ Fight** which I discovered this morning but was released all the way back in April by **[FatCat Records](http://fat-cat.co.uk/fatcat/)**.

My late discovery of this album has really annoyed me, because I've only gone and compiled my **[Top 10 Albums of 2008](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/top-10-albums-of-2008/)** early, thus denying this spectacular record its deserved spot.  Curses! Don't I feel silly now...

Coincidentally, this latest **Frightened Rabbit** album has been the topic of some heated debate on the **[Song, by Toad](http://songbytoad.com/2008/12/08/live-in-edinburgh-this-week-7th-december-2008/#comment-24245)** site (scroll down to the "comments" bit to see what I'm on about).  Many are the detractors that claim the record sounds unforgivably like **Snow Patrol**.  Which is _almost_ true.  Sure, there's epic-indie-high-register-guitar-pedals aplenty, and the voices are somewhat similar, but this records contains lyrics that **Snow Patrol** would never dare put on a record.  It's a dirty, aggressive and confrontational album, and I love them for it.  **Poke** is my new favourite song by miles.

Get yourselves a copy, if only for the uncommon and well-overdue satisfaction of seeing **Bon Iver** being knocked for six...
