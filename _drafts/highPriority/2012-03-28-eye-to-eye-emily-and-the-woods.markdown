If you ask me, **Newton Faulkner** suffered at the hands of his producer. Sure, his songs might not be all that great, but he was a powerful live performer with charm and talent aplenty; on record, however, he merely comes across as Mr. Bland from Bland City. I mention Faulkner here to highlight the delicate and mystical alchemy that goes into capturing a great live performer 'on tape' and how such a process can easily miss its mark.

My first exposure to [**Emily And The Woods**](http://www.facebook.com/emilyandthewoods) - the _nom de guerre_ of singer/songwriter Emily Wood - was the session she did for [Location Music TV](http://locationmusic.tv/) back in November **2011**, and while I've never seen her play live, this 'live' session (along with the many others she's recorded for a whole host of people) shows an adept and assured solo performer.

So what, then, of her recordings? Fleshed out with a full line-up, the songs hold up remarkably well. Perhaps that the extra instrumentation meshes so well with Emily's hushed and delicate vocal stylings is the result of the band being something of a family affair - with a Benjamin Wood on electric guitar and a Patrick Wood handling acoustic guitar, bass and piano along with the production duties.

All in all the Woods' production seems to be something of a self-made affair, with no visible signs of label support or any of the trappings of the industry at large. The only people visibly backing her are OMG Music, a fledgling production company based in Surrey (who, ironically, represent a certain Mr. Faulkner) but despite the apparent lack of resources, her _[Eye To Eye](http://emilyandthewoods.bigcartel.com/product/eye-to-eye)_ **EP** sounds remarkably professional.

If I'm honest, this 'professional' sheen could be as much a curse as a blessing: the traditional word to use in these circumstances is 'slick', and that's not a charge that sits well with the delightfully ramshackle performances that come across in her live videos. That said, the only real flaw that I can detect in the record is the slightly overzealous percussion that's been slapped all over _Steal His Heart_, which is a shame, as it's my favourite song of hers. But then my opinion of the song was forged watching her solo performance, so maybe I'm just predisposed to prefer a stripped back version.

The **EP** certainly seems to be going down well in the blogosphere, and it was only after [a whole slew of favourable reviews over at Breaking More Waves](http://breakingmorewaves.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Emily%20and%20the%20Woods) that I finally got around to buying _Eye To Eye_ (which can be found, along with a few other things, at her [Big Cartel shop page](http://emilyandthewoods.bigcartel.com/)). It's been a few months since the **EP** was launched, but **Emily And The Woods** are still releasing a steady stream of impressive performances through YouTube, and with the growing groundswell of blog-based support I'll bet it won't be long before they hit the big time. This is one band wagon I'll be proud to say I jumped on as soon as I was able.
