![MumfordAndSons_LittleLionMan](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/mumfordandsons_littlelionman.jpg)

This band has been scooting round the periphery of my musical awareness for quite a while now. With good reviews from all sorts of blogs that I respect I should really have made an effort to get into them sooner. Alas, it actually took a chance encounter at *Radio One* to alert me to the fact that this band are actually very good. *Radio One*, of all places! Christ alive, I never thought I'd see the day. Anyway, **Mumford and Sons** had recorded on of **R1's** *Live Lounge* sessions, and the track that hooked me in was _Little Lion Man_ - despite the fact that a substantial part of the chorus had been muted due to excess profanity.

The day after this accidental **R1** experience I listened to a session/interview that the band had recorded for [The Waiting Room](http://www.twrhq.com/) online radio show. Again, it was excellent, and again it was _Little Lion Man_ that stood out. It turns out that I actually already had the band's **EP** _Love Your Ground_ - featuring _Little Lion Man_ - in my *iTunes* library, but hadn't taken the time to listen to it. A shocking oversight, I'm sure you'll agree.
