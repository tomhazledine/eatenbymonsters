As regular readers will be well aware, I'm a big fan of *Pissing on Bonfires/Kissing With Tongues*, the debut album from the Scots roustabouts **Meursault**. I'm a little late in reviewing this new **EP** of theirs, _Nothing Broke_, primarily because I wanted to give myself ample time to absorb it.

The packaging for this **EP** is superb; a (presumably) cheap cardboard sleeve with a hand painted/drawn design, hand-stamped and hand-numbered. It feels like a lot of thought and a lot of love went into making this **EP** - it's a real boutique product. There's only **300** of them, too, so if you're a fan I suggest you get your order in before they sell out.

Texturally it's a markedly different beast to the album. The digital elements have all been replaced by a much sparser, acoustic atmosphere. Mainly because, one assumes, the line-up of the band has changed somewhat since the first record was recorded. I gather *PoB/KWT* was a studio-based venture, where frontman Neil Pennycook played most of the stuff, but since then **Meursault** have become a band proper (as you can see from their [Toad Session](http://songbytoad.com/2008/08/toadcast-35-meursault-toad-session/)).

I certainly like this **EP** a lot, but I'm not sure I'll ever come to love it. Without the more jagged elements (the programed beeps, drums and sine waves from the album) this record seems to be treading water. The forward momentum that gave *PoB/KWT* it's sparkle is not as evident here, and quite frankly this is due to the songs. The more introspective feel and tone are evident in the structure of the songs as much as in the instrumentation used. There's plenty of space in this **EP** - which I would say is ultimately a good thing - but it does rob the music of the drive (and perhaps the passion?) that so attracted me to the album.

In conclusion, this is certainly a very good **EP** in all senses; it's keeping fan's appetites keen, and makes for a jolly good listen. I would say, however, that it doesn't hold a candle to **Meursault**'s album. This release is more for the fans; if you're new to the band then I'd recommend you explore the album thoroughly first.

*N.B. As you can see from the comments section, due to popular demand it would appear they've made some more.*
