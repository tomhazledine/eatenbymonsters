_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

Way back in 2007 - before he'd even released his first album, _Falling Off The Lavender Bridge_ - Dev Hynes, a.k.a. [Lightspeed Champion](http://www.lightspeedchampion.com/), built his reputation by releasing several home-recorded EPs.  One of those was the creatively-titled _Garageband Xmas EP_, the two best tracks of which can be found at the bottom of this post.
