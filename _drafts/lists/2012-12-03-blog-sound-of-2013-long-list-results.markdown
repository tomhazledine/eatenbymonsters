[![Blog Sound of 2013 Logo](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blogsound2013-LOGO-300x225.jpg)](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/?attachment_id=1407#main)Woohoo! Finally it's here! In all honesty I've been looking forward to 'list season' since January. My own yearly top 10 lists will make an appearance in the coming days, but before that here's a more collaborative effort that looks to the future rather than the past. Spurred on by the ever-increasing irrelevance of the BBC's annual "Sound Of..."  poll, Andy from the Von Pip Musical Express decided to start his own. This is the second year it's run, and once again I'm proud to have been a part of it.

It's an interesting project. Of [last years recommendations](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/2011/12/05/blog-sound-of-2012-long-list-results/), most sank without trace as so often happens when critics try to predict rather than react, but there were some exceptions. Crucially, the 'Blog Sound' list contained the now-world-conquering Alt J (or ∆ if  you prefer) who won this year's Mercury Prize and weren't featured on the Beeb's list at all. Who knows what 2013 will bring, but some of us think it might contain some, all, or none of the acts on this years Blog Sound of 2013 Long List:


**AlunaGeorge**




**Curxes**




**Chvrches**




**Daughter**




**Haim**




**Laura Mvula**




**MØ**




**Palma Violets**




**Pins**




**Randolph’s Leap**




**Rhye**




**Savages**




**Seasfire**




**The Neighbourhood**




**Tom Odell**


I'm ashamed to say that none of those were my picks. Chvrches are obviously going places, and Randolph's Leap are rather good, but there's nothing else on the list that really excites me. Daughter was on last years BS list, and her track _Medicine_ isn't too offensive, but it's going to be really interesting to compare this list with the Beeb's own efforts.

Part of me is disappointed that my tastes don't align with my peers, but equally I can take solace in the fact that I'm still cutting my own path through the new-music firmament. If I was only rehashing what other people thought then there'd be no point in my blogging at all. Interestingly, after all 49 contributors to this poll had cast their votes, over 170 acts received just one vote, so I guess the majority of bloggers are in a similar situation to me. While the top 15 may not meet with my personal approval, this poll does suggest that the blogosphere in general is a rather healthy place at the moment.

The top five of this poll will be announced on the 3rd January, and I'll post a piece on my own picks for 2013 around that time too. But that's looking to far ahead; we've got List Season to get through first!
