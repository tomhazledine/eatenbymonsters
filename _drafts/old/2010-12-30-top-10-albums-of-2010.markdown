[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img-mg-classic-christmas-10_152556543880.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/img-mg-classic-christmas-10_152556543880.jpg)With Christmas now behind us for another year we can all pick our selves up, shake of the excess wrapping paper and chocolate and resume our normal routines.  Being just days away from the new year it'll soon be time to look towards the future, but for now it's time for a nostalgic look back at the year past; it's list time, folks! While this might be the correct moment to write a retrospective look at the whole decade*, I think I'll limit myself to the more manageable task of listing my favourite 10 albums that 2010 had to offer.

It's been an interesting year for music, but strangely it's been one that has thrown up fewer "new" musical passions than previous years.  Looking back at my [Top 10 from 2008](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/top-10-albums-of-2008/), 7 of those albums were debut LPs by new artists, and while I didn't publish my "best of 2009" the ratio of new acts to established ones was much the same.  This year, however, only 4 of the albums are debuts.  It seems to have been a year for great albums by well loved bands, but this in itself took me a little by surprise as there has been a whole slew of albums by bands I already loved that didn't live up to expectations at all.  There was a certain element of schadenfreude in seeing the mediocre efforts by darlings of the HypeMachine  (Vampire Weekend and MGMT) sink without trace, but Dan Le Sac vs. Scroobius Pip, [Jim Moray](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/10/01/in-modern-history-jim-moray/), [Band of Horses](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/infinite-arms-band-of-horses/), [Johnny Flynn](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/11/09/been-listening-johnny-flynn/) and [We Are Scientists](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/barbara-we-are-scientists/) should all have been capable of much better.  This rather dismal showing from such highly anticipated records has had the effect of clearing the way for less obvious successes, and has made for a much more varied list than previous years have thrown up.

So without further ado, here is the moment you've all been waiting for since January; the official Eaten by Monsters blog Top Ten of 2010:

Like a pernicious virus it has managed to infect most of the past twelve months of my listening, so in the interests of full disclosure I can't help but include it here, albeit with plenty of caveats.

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/foals_totallifeforever.jpg?w=150)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/foals_totallifeforever.jpg)9. **_Total Life Forever_ by Foals.** I quite liked Foals' last record, but didn't really think it was anything all that special.  It was a little bit too "trendy", and it goes without saying that any band that can be described as "darlings of the NME" probably aren't going to be my cup of tea at all.  And with their latest effort, Total Life Forever, they're still just as achingly hip, but this time it's tempered with an earnestness that just about overrides the hipster aspect.  No band that cares this much can ever be truly cool, so now I feel I can enjoy their music with impunity.[audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/2010Top10/Foals_SpanishSahara.mp3]

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/meursault-allcreatureswillmakemerry1.jpg?w=150)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/meursault-allcreatureswillmakemerry1.jpg)8. **_All Creatures Will Make Merry_ by Meursault.** Meursault's 2009 EP, _Nothing Broke,_ seemed to be the moment when vast swathes of the public realised that the band were actually rather good, but strangely enough it didn't have that effect on me.  While the new-found acoustic sensibilities were well meaning and competently executed, I found myself missing the electronic elements that made their debut LP so bewitching.  Thankfully _All Creatures Will Make Merry_ has fused the best bits of both of their "sounds" to great effect, and heralds a stunning return to form.[audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/2010Top10/Meursault_CrankResolutions.mp3]

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/yeasayer_oddblood.jpg?w=150)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/yeasayer_oddblood.jpg)7. **_Odd Blood_ by Yeasayer.** This LP is alone on this list for being the only record that I don't feel works properly as an album.  All the other entries here are records that have mastered the exquisite pushing and pulling of tension and the sense of an overarching vision that are essential when crafting a bona-fide album.  So why has it made this list? Quite frankly, solely on the strength of the individual songs themselves.  Much like Ellie Goulding's _Lights_, _Odd Blood_ has wheedled its way into my affections by simply having great songs.  And as a festive bonus the band are giving away a rather impressive live album (in exchange for nothing more than an e-mail address) over at their website.[audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/2010Top10/Yeasayer_AmblingAlp.mp3]

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/broadcast2000.jpg?w=150)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/broadcast2000.jpg)6. **_Broadcast 2000_ by Broadcast 2000**.  This LP is an example of that rare and mythical beast, an album that is clearly great from the first few seconds of the first listen.  Much as I expected at the time, repeat listens have revealed it to be slightly less than the instant classic that first impressions suggested, but it is nonetheless still a very good record indeed.  Home-recorded albums often have an intangible, but instantly recognisable sheen to them that identifies them as the work of just one person, and while that is certainly in evidence here, the record still manages to rise above the morass of other self-produced efforts.[audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/2010Top10/Broadcast2000_RouseYourBones.mp3]

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/villagers_becomingajackal.jpg?w=150)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/villagers_becomingajackal.jpg)5. **_Becoming a Jackal_ by Villagers.** I came rather late to the Villagers' party, and being as I like to pride myself on being ahead of the curve, my ego wouldn't let me like this record for a good long while; if all these people started to pay attention before I did, then it's clearly not going to be any good, I told myself.  Thankfully I've now come to my senses and accepted the fact that this record is so popular purely because it is, indeed, excellent._ You can read my full review of this album [here](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/11/03/becoming-a-jackal-the-villagers/)._[audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/2010Top10/Villagers_Home.mp3]
