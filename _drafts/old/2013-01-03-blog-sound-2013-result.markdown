Here it is folks, the top five acts that UK bloggers think will define the musical landscape in 2013.

[![Blog Sound of 2013 Logo](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/blogsound2013-LOGO-620x465.jpg)](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/2012/12/03/blog-sound-of-2013-long-list-results/blogsound2013-logo/#main)Respect is due to [Robin](http://breakingmorewaves.blogspot.co.uk/) and [Andy](http://www.thevpme.com/) for running this poll, which I imagine was quite a challenge. A total of 170 acts were voted for by 49 bloggers, and such is the disparate nature of the blogosphere at the moment I'm guessing the majority of those nominated only received one vote. This, I'm assuming, explains why I wasn't too excited about the [longlist](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/2012/12/03/blog-sound-of-2013-long-list-results/), as the more leftfield acts I was hoping to see weren't able to generate the critical mass of both awareness and popularity to make the cut.


## 5. The Neighbourhood


There's nothing about [The Neighbourhood](https://www.facebook.com/TheNeighbourhood) I like. Well, I guess they know how to spell _neighourhood_ properly at least.


## 3=. Pins


[Pins](http://www.wearepins.co.uk/) are a little too sixties-lo-fi for my taste, but they're not actively terrible, which given the state of the longlist I guess counts as a win.


## 3=. Savages


I dislike some of the other acts in this list on genre grounds, but I ought to like [Savages](http://savagesband.com/). I really don't, though.


## 2. Chvrches


I've probably said enough about [Chvrches](https://www.facebook.com/CHVRCHES) on this blog already. I quite like them, but they've been getting so much coverage here that there's a danger that people might miss out the 'quite' at the start of this sentence. They're okay, and certainly the best of the top five, but I won't go further than that.


## 1. Haim


I didn't think people manufactured family soft-rock bands anymore, but apparently they still do. [Haim](http://haimtheband.com/) sound like they've stepped right out of nineties American drive-time radio. In a bad way.



Honestly, while I wish all the bands in the top five well, I really don't want this selection to define the music of 2013. The beauty of new bands, thankfully, is that they're new, so the acts that will most likely shape the next twelve months haven't been heard by anyone yet. If they sound like this, though, then it might be a pretty grim year.

Here's the full list of all the bloggers who voted in the poll:
