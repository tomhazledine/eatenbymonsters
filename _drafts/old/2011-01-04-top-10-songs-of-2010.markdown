As per tradition (if something can be called a tradition if you've only done it once before...) here's my list of the top songs of 2010.  Well, it's something of a misnomer, to be honest, as most of my favourite songs of the year have already featured in my [Top 10 Albums ](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/top-10-albums-of-2010/)post, so this is an opportunity to recognise the impressive efforts of those bands who weren't eligible for inclusion on that list.  Some of these are good tracks from otherwise bad albums, others from records that only missed out by the skin of their teeth, and yet more come from bands who didn't release a full album this year.  No matter what their provenance, however, all ten of these songs are well deserving of their places.  When viewed together, the Top 10 Albums and Top 10 Songs lists are a solid representation of what I think the best music of 2010 was.

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/vampireweekend_contra.jpg?w=148)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/vampireweekend_contra.jpg)8. **_I Think Ur A Contra_ by Vampire Weekend**.  For an album that was hyped to high heaven, Vampire Weekend's sophomore effort, Contra, was something of a wet sock.  I liked their first album - not as much as some, to be sure, but I did like it - but Contra left me very cold indeed.  The final track, however, is a little slice of production genius, so while they weren't within a country mile of the Top 10 Albums list, they scoop a consolation placement here.

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/robertsmith.jpg?w=150)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/robertsmith.jpg)6. **_Not In Love _by Crystal Castles ft. Robert Smith**.  I don't normally have any time for Crystal Castles; their music is just not my cup of tea at all, which I imagine will come of no surprise to my regular readers.  If I want to listen to dance music then... well, I may as well chop my ears off, quite frankly.  As far as I'm concerned it's the last haven for the criminally unmusical; the only thing worse than a dance track is a dance track remix... Add Robert Smith into the mix, however, and I'm all ears; this cheeky little cover warrants a pretty decent placement on this list purely because it's so nice to hear his dulcet tones again.

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/stornoway_zorbing.jpg?w=150)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/stornoway_zorbing.jpg)3. **_Zorbing_ by Stornoway**.  I first came across this fantastic song when the band played a BBC session at this year's Glastonbury.  Alas, the production on their album doesn't quite capture the magic of their live presence; they're trying to make it too ethereal, when in my view a more grounded, less reverb-heavy approach would suit them better.  Thankfully all the production niggles in the world couldn't stop this track from being absolutely super.

Oh if only these guys had recorded a full album - how fantastic it would have been! Still, it's early days for yet for Toodar, and their star is still on the ascendent, so I'm hoping for an album soon.  There was a lot of shuffling and re-shuffling in the order of this list prior to publication, but the one thing that didn't change was that this song was in the top slot.  By far and away the best song I've heard all year. _Read my full review of their EP [here](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/toodar/). _[audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/2010Top10/Toodar_TenPaces.mp3]
