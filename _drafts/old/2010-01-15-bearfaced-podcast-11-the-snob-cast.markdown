[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/snob_venn_diagram.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/snob_venn_diagram.jpg)Well happy new year, folks.  The first [Bearfaced Podcast](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#podcasts/) of 2010 is upon us, and this time there's a slightly unusual playlist.  The theme for this episode is "musical snobbery" and looks at all the stuff we really ought to have turned our noses up at; good songs by bands that we'd never actually admit to liking, and that sort of thing.

There's also a couple of Christmas songs thrown in for good measure - now the joy of yuletide has past us by, how well does this year's crop of festive songs hold up in the cold hard light of the new year?

As always, you can find the ‘cast in iTunes, download each episode directly from the Podcast page of the [Bearfaced Records website](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#podcasts/latest/), or simply listen to the embedded player below.  Enjoy…
