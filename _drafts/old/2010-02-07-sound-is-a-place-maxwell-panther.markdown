I often take great pleasure in being contrary; if most of the blogoshere says that 2+2=4 there's half a chance I'll say it's 5.  Every so often, however, I find myself agreeing with the throng.  The new Maxwell Panther LP_Do You Feel Different Yet?_ has just been released on [Song, by Toad Records](http://songbytoadrecords.com/), and every single review that I've read makes  quite a fuss of the production values.  Everyone appears to be reveling in the low-fi nature of the recording, so naturally I'd made up my mind not to descend to this oh-so-obvious observation.  Alas, one cannot fully discuss the music of Maxwell Panther without touching on the production; it was the elephant in the room for my first attempt at writing this review, not of the _Do You Feel Different Yet?_ LP - because I've not heard all of it - but of the [_Sound is a Place_](http://maxwellpanther.bandcamp.com/)_ _EP launched through [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/) late last year.

First and foremost, the songs are good; I could blather on about the production until the cows come home, but it would all be somewhat pointless if the songs didn't cut the mustard.  Often one will come across a record that can be flatteringly described as "scratchy" where the songs are as ropey as the production; it's quite common to find something of worth hidden under the flaws, and see the "potential" in the record, at the very least on a "_their next record is going to be great_" level.  Thankfully with _Sound is a Place_, the songwriting is a _fait accompli_; mature and sophisticated, there's no need to look for the "potential" because it's already been realised.  And this is a crucial point when discussing a record such as this.  It's practically universally agreed that the songwriting is the most important element of a record, and it's certainly a point of view I agree with.  A good song can easily eclipse bad technique, but that's not the case with this record - the writing is of such a high standard that the production ethos can _only_ be an artistic choice.

**Long Story Short:** To listen to _Sound is a Place_ and think that the production is "bad" is to miss the point entirely; the fuzziness, the hiss, it's all intentional.  This EP should be absorbed as a complete package, as the production re-enforces the songwriting which in turn re-enforces the production...  _Sound is a Place_ can be bought via an "honesty box" system over at the [Maxwell Panther Bandcamp page](http://maxwellpanther.bandcamp.com/), and the new album _[Do You Feel Different Yet? ](http://songbytoadrecords.com/maxwell-panther/do-you-feel-different-yet/)_is out now on Song, by Toad records.
