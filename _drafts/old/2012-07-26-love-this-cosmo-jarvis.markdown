Another great low-budget video for your delectation today. This one's been sitting in my inbox for over a month now, which means I'm coming a little late to the [Cosmo Jarvis](http://cosmojarvis.com/) party. People who got there before I did include Brian Eno and Jarvis Cocker, and while I'm never sure if celebrity endorsements actually help launch an artist, accolades from names like those can't do any harm (although I seem to remember hearing something recently about the 'curse' of an endorsement from Morrissey...). Anyway, late or not, this video for _Love This_ is fantastic and the song's of equal quality.  It came out at the start of July, and was quickly followed by a full-length release, _Think Bigger_.
