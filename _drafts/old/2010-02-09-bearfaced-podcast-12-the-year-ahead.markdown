[](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/20100209_podcast12_finalimage.jpg)As promised in the [last 'cast](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/01/15/bearfaced-podcast-11-the-snob-cast/), here's the [Bearfaced Podcast](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#podcasts/latest/) guide to what's going to be hot in the 2010 musical landscape.  If I'm honest, this is one of the best playlists we've had on the 'casts to date; there's tracks from old BF Podcast favourites like [Frightened Rabbit](http://www.myspace.com/frightenedrabbit), [Meursault](http://songbytoadrecords.com/artists/meursault/) and [Lightspeed Champion](http://www.lightspeedchampion.com/) - who all have albums out this year - as well as some new discoveries like [The Kays Lavelle](http://www.myspace.com/thekayslavelle) and [The Black Atlantic](http://www.myspace.com/theblackatlantic).  There will most likely be full reviews of all these albums as-and-when I get my hands on them, but for now this 'cast should serve as a nice potted introduction to what I'm sure will be a great year for music.

As always, you can find the ‘cast in iTunes, download each episode directly from the Podcast page of the [Bearfaced Records website](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#tagged/?id=142), or simply listen to the embedded player below.  Enjoy…
