**n[ational anthem](http://www.national-anthem.co.uk/releases/)** are clearly a project to keep a weather-eye on. Flushed with their end-of-year successes with Haim and Chvrches, the boutique singles label have now secured the release of an **ep** by Aussie duo **[atlas genius](http://www.atlasgenius.com/)**. The song **trojans** itself has gained quite a bit of traction state-side, and the band will be releasing their debut long-player at the end of the month. A couple of days before that, however, you can get the **uk** release of the track on it's own **ep** from the **national anthem** website.

If ridiculously expensive limited-edition vinyl releases are your thing (and they certainly are mine) then the **na** page is definitely one to add to your bookmarks, but you need to be quick - the Haim and Chvrches records are all sold-out, and I imagine the **atlas genius** record may go the same way in double quick time. This is indie electro-pop at its very best; a little slice of summer to stave off the hail and sleet.
