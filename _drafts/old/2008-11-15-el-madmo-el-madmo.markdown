[![elmadmo](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/elmadmo.jpg?w=199)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/elmadmo.jpg)Well this one came out all the way back in May, and isn't anything musicaly groundbreaking at all.  If fact, it's not even any good.  "So, why am I posting about it?" I hear you cry. Well, before I reveal all my secrets I recommend you have a listen to the band...

Oh yeah, baby: it's Norah Jones.  I have to say I was more than a little surprised by this one.  I guess it's only good for a quick chuckle, but if you do want to buy it then you can get the whole album at [their page on the Team Love site](http://team-love.com/home/artists/el-madmo/) (that's right, they're a Team Love signing; hence how I discovered them during my exploration of all things TL for the profile earlier in the week).
