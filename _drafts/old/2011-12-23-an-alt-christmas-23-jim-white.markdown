_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

Long and slow, yet haunting and atmospheric, this track is one of [Jim White](http://www.jimwhite.net/)'s best.  In fact, _No Such Place_ - the album this song was taken from - is a genuine classic, the overall strength of which means _Christmas Day_ is often pushed into the shadows, and it's only at this time of year that it gets the attention it so richly deserves.
