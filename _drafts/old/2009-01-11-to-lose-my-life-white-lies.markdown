![whitelies](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/whitelies.jpg?w=300)As I mentioned in my last post, BBC 6 Music have been making an awful lot of noise about their _Sound of 2009_ list.  White Lies are second on that list (after Little Boots, whom I've already profiled on [these hallowed pages...](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2009/01/09/little-boots-6-musics-sound-of-2009/)).  Now anyone who's been near a radio in the last few weeks will have heard their single _To Lose My Life_, and if you have any sense at all you'll already hate it.  Added to this, the singer seemed to be having a little trouble hitting the notes in the chorus when they preformed it in The Hub.

Not an auspicous start, I'm sure you'll agree; and certainly enough to ensure I dismissed them without much of a thought.

In my more reflective (read: pretentious) moments I like to kick back with some french philosophic literature, a cup of strong home-ground coffee (single origin, no less; none of that "blend" nonsense) and some Esbjörn Svensson Trio on the stereo.  The now sadly departed Esbjörn Svensson and his eponymous trio are/were possibly the "coolest" jazz band around.  In this case I mean cool in two ways.  Firstly, image-wise: they were stick thin, foreign and almost always photographed in black and white.  Secondly, and more importantly, music-wise: drums, bass and piano is just about as good as jazz gets in my opinion, and on top of that they had a taste for the experimental and were great believers in the joys of fuzz boxes.

Now imagine my horror when midway through a relaxing evening I'm assaulted by a track that sounds like it's come straight from the Terminator soundtrack.  It turns out that White Lies have a track called _E. S. T._ A traumatising experience, I'm sure you'll agree.  Once I recovered from the shock, however, it turned out that the White Lies track wasn't half as bad as I was expecting, inspiring me to give them a second chance.

Ultimately they're actually not too bad a band, and I might have quite liked them a few years ago.  But to be frank; do we really need another Joy Division cover band? I think not.

It's always a shame to dismiss a band's entire repertoire with such a sweeping generalisation, but alas, with this type of band it's pretty much inevitable.  I was only ever a casual Joy Division listener (I like the hits and watched the films, but couldn't ever fully appreciate a whole album of the stuff) and the truth is that I enjoy the the copycats (Interpol, The Bravery, Placebo, The Editors, _et al_) far more than the source material.  There are hundreds of them, though, and I subconsciously group them all together - guilty by association, if you will.  It's a pity, as White Lies have actually got a few good songs; it would be great to hear this band if they'd at least attempted to find a genre of their own and hadn't ended up being so derivative.

White Lies are on Fiction Records, which is a Polydor imprint if I'm not mistaken, and I'm not sure what their views are regarding bloggers giving their tunes away, so you'll have to be content with streamed audio for this post.  In recompense, I've included several tracks for your listening pleasure:

The godawful single _To Lose My Life_, in case you've been living in a hole lately and haven't heard it yet: [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/WhiteLies/WhiteLies_ToLoseMyLife.mp3]

Their song _E. S. T. _[audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/WhiteLies/WhiteLies_EST.mp3]

And their source material, _á la_ Terminator 2: Judgment Day...  [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/WhiteLies/TerminatorTheme.mp3]

And finally some decent music to undo the damage of the last 3 tracks: Esbjörn Svensson Trio's Goldwrap. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/WhiteLies/EST_Goldwrap.mp3]
