_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

I mentioned in the first post of this Christmas series that I am a big fan of the XO for the Holidays compilations, and here's further proof of that.  I'm not usually a fan of bands that put a Micro Korg front-and-centre, but despite doing this [The Winter Sounds](http://www.thewintersounds.com/) have thoroughly won me over. The second of the tracks below, _Stranded In Snowville_, is taken from this year's comp which you can download in full from [here](http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays4.html).  The first, _The Anthem Is A Gift_, was featured on the second XO comp back in 2009 (which can still be downloaded from [here](http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays2.html)), and is one of that rare breed of Christmas songs that make me sad I can't listen to them for the rest of the year.  Obviously to actually listen to it all year round would wear away some of the magic and excitement that December provides, so if you need The Winter Sounds in summer, head over to [their bandcamp page](http://thewintersounds.bandcamp.com/).
