[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/meursault_whm12.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/meursault_whm12.jpg)It's not often that I dig out the ol' vinyl player.  If fact, being the fresh faced youth I am, the world of vinyl is one of which I have only a cursory knowledge.  Anytime I want to enjoy my (admittedly meagre) 7" collection I have to drag my dad's old [Pioneer PL-112D](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3560/3320377796_6c0cec9d21.jpg) turntable out of the attic...

But it does appear that the 7" is still alive and well.  An old flatmate of mine had quite an impressive collection - all released in the last few years - and most singles seem to get a 7" release alongside the newer formats.  These two singles from [Song, by Toad Records](http://songbytoadrecords.com/) are available exclusively as vinyl (not counting digitally, which surely doesn't count these days).  The band behind this pair of singles is [Meursault](http://songbytoadrecords.com/artists/meursault/), already an Eaten by Monsters favourite owing to their fantastic debut LP, [_Pissing on Bonfires/Kissing With Tongues_](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/pissing-on-bonfireskissing-with-tongues-meursault/).

Now I gather that William Henry Miller is something of a live favourite for hardcore Meusault fans, but I must admit that when it was finally released (on last years _[Nothing Broke](http://songbytoadrecords.com/meursault/nothing-broke/)_ EP) I wasn't all that taken with it.  To be honest, [I wasn't that taken with the whole EP](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2009/05/15/nothing-broke-meursault/); I enjoyed it, for sure, but having never seen the band live and getting to know them through their album, the change of direction (from dense electronic soundscapes with a furious energy to a slower, more contemplative acoustic sound) wasn't what I was looking for.  In the months following it's release _Nothing Broke _has certainly grown on me, but in my opinion these two new singles mark a welcome return to the more "produced"* sound of _Pissing/Kissing_.  In fact, the B-sides (_The Dirt and the Roots_ and _A Few Kind Words_ respectively) are the same cuts that were used on the album.

And now _William Henry Miller Pt. II_ - a track that sounded decidedly like filler on _Nothing Broke_ - is now the stand out track of both these singles;  a feat made doubly impressive when you consider that _A Few Kind Words_ (the _Pt. II_ B-side) was one of my favourite tracks on the album, which was in turn one of my [Top 10 Albums of 2008](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/top-10-albums-of-2008/).  And _Pt. I_ has undergone a caterpillar/butterfly rebirth as well!  The word on the street is that Meursault are on the brink of writing/recording a new album, and if that's true then I really can't wait.

And as being as posting both the A-sides would be a bit cheekey, here's a live version (subtitled Dylan Gives the Clap) that they recorded during last year's Homegame for The Waiting Room:
