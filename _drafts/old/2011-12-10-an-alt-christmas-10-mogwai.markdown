_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

In order to make this Christmas song list a little more relaxing I present this track from Scotts Godspeed-wannabes [Mogwai](http://www.mogwai.co.uk/), taken from their imaginatively titled EP, _EP._  I'm only a casual fan of the band, but the little I've heard I've liked quite a lot, and this track seems to be fairly representative of their output.
