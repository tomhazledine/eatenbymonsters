_[Not everyone loves Christmas songs but I, for one, can't get enough of them.  Every year it seems we get the same old perennial hits, and I guess that's part of the charm - Christmas is a time for comforting familiarity after all - but most of these aren't as fulfilling as one might hope, musically speaking.  Never fear, however, as this Yuletide help is at hand, in the form of Eaten by Monsters' selection of the best alternative Christmas songs out there.]_

My christmas picks have been a decidedly cheery of late, so who better to bring the mood down than EbM favourites [Frightened Rabbit](http://frightenedrabbit.com/)? There's a couple of versions of this little ditty kicking about the place - including one sung by a choir (minus lyrics, sadly; it's just humming) - but this one is my favourite.  It's slightly tougher and less, well, smooth, and that's generally how I like my FR to sound.  When reviewing [their recent EP](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/a-frightened-rabbit-ep-frightened-rabbit/), I bemoaned the lack of producer Peter Katis' glossy presence, but in this instance the homemade rough-and-ready aspect works wonderfully.
