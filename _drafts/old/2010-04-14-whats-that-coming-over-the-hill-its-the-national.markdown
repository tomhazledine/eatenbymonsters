[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/thenational.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/thenational.jpg)Okay, okay; I know I've not been a very good blogger lately, but I can change.  I promise, darling, this will "never" happen again.  Basically the combination of a new job and a busted hard-drive conspired to keep me from you, but I've been sitting on some pretty peachy music lately, so expect a glut of great reviews and suchlike in the immediate future.

For now though, dear readers, sate your thirst for exciting new music with the news that on the 10th of May* [4AD](http://www.4ad.com/) will release _High Violet_, the latest LP from EbM favourites [The National](http://www.americanmary.com/).  I've not heard the whole thing yet, but I have managed to get my grubby little paws on two of the tracks which I have kindly included for your delectation below...

The National - [Afraid of Everyone](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/TheNational/TheNational_AfraidOfEveryone.mp3) [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/TheNational/TheNational_AfraidOfEveryone.mp3]

The National - [Bloodbuzz Ohio](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/TheNational/TheNational_BloodbuzzOhio.mp3) [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/TheNational/TheNational_BloodbuzzOhio.mp3]

*in the UK at least; I think it's the 11th for those of you across the pond.
