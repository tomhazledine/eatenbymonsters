_[Not everyone loves Christmas songs but I, for one, can't get enough of them.  Every year it seems we get the same old perennial hits, and I guess that's part of the charm - Christmas is a time for comforting familiarity after all - but most of these aren't as fulfilling as one might hope, musically speaking.  Never fear, however, as this Yuletide help is at hand, in the form of Eaten by Monsters' selection of the best alternative Christmas songs out there.]_

This is a genuine Christmas favourite of mine.  I've always loved [Eels](http://www.eelstheband.com/), and this track is the first in this series to display what I would call a genuine Christmas spirit.
