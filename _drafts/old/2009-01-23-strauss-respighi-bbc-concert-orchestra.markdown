![bbcco](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/bbcco.jpg?w=300)Last week I dragged myself all the way to the Watford Colosseum to see a workshop by Charles Hazlewood and the BBC Concert Orchestra.  It was called a _Homage to Ancient Music_ and focused on both (Richard) Strauss' _Divertimento on themes by Couperin_, and Respighi's _The Birds_; both of which are 20thC works that paid homage to works from the Baroque/Renaissance (and therefore "early").

Recorded by BBC Radio 3 as part of their [_Discovering Music_](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/discovering-music-bbc-radio-3/) series, it was always going to be an interesting lecture.  Hazlewood is one of the more populist composers/broadcasters on the BBC's payroll, and he's of the firm belief that classical music should be for _everyone_.  Thankfully this doesn't mean that he's at all condescending or patronizing in his approach, but merely results in his lectures being accessible to anyone, no matter what their knowledge level.  If you have no musical-theory knowledge at all you'll find this an insightful and engaging look at some unfamiliar pieces, and if you are a theory wiz' there's still enough technical detail to keep you happy as well.

Recorded orchestral music just can't compare to witnessing it in the flesh.  The BBC Concert Orchestra (in this instance augmented with a harpsichord to provide "period" example of the source material) are consummate professionals and it was a joy to see them at work.  I shan't go into the detail of the workshop here: you'll have to wait for the show's broadcast date (I'll post a reminder when I know the actual date it'll be going out on) which will be on a Sunday afternoon/evening.  That way you'll also get to hear my dulcet tones on national radio, as I asked a very astute and intelligent-sounding question at the end.
