_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

Now we're within sight of the finish line, it's time to bring out the big guns; none of the songs in this festive selection have been anything less than good, but now is the time to take it up a notch.  These last four tracks are not only great Christmas songs, but simply great songs, period.  [Withered Hand](http://witheredhand.com/) (a.k.a. Dan Willson) have (has) just released a new Christmas song [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FarG6Y0pkFk) called _Real Snow_, but it's their (his) home-recorded effort from a couple of years ago that really struck a chord with me.
