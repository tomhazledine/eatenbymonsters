I know this is almost a whole month premature, but there's all sorts of reasons for getting my list out early.  December is the time when everyone begins to take stock of the year's achievements and gets all nostalgic about the blue remembered hills of the past twelve months, so there's a more receptive audience for this kind of post.  Plus, when January comes around it'll be time to look forward to the bright and promising future, so nostalgia is officially banned.  It's also nearly Christmas and lists like this one are an easy way to decide on presents for people.  The guys at [Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/) are compiling their Music Blog Zeitgeist 2008, so I have to publish my list before the fifteenth for it to be eligible, and  December is traditionally a rubbish month for music anyway.  As a result of the (100% guaranteed to be horrendous) Christmas No. 1 Battle, if a label releases an "alternative" record in December it's because they're 100% sure it will flop.  So hopefully there won't be any great records that miss out on their deserved place on this list.

2008's been an exceedingly good year for music, and compiling this list was a tough, tough process.  Thankfully I'm the kind of person who takes perverse pleasure in attributing arbitrary relative values to songs and fitting them into a meritocracy (as evidenced by the weekly Top Fives).  It must be noted that a lot of my favourite music from 2008 didn't come from an actual album, so I will be writing a _Top 10 Songs of 2008_ post probably nearer to the actual end of the year.

So here it is - the moment we've all been waiting for since January:

[![whenthehaarrollsin_cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/whenthehaarrollsin_cover.jpg?w=95)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/whenthehaarrollsin_cover.jpg)9. **_When the Haar Rolls In_ by James Yorkston**.  This album has almost exactly the same texture as his past few records, but when you sound this good consistency is no bad thing.  Every time he releases a new CD there's loads of press chatter about how this'll-be-the-one-that-breaks-him-into-the-mainstream, but his records always seems to slip under the radar, which is a darned shame.

[![vampireweekend_cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/vampireweekend_cover.jpg?w=96)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/vampireweekend_cover.jpg)8. **_Vampire Weekend_ by Vampire Weekend**.  A rarity in that it was lauded by both the music press and the popular press, this little record did rather well for itself in the early part of the year.  It's stuffed full of great songs, but the most enjoyable part of it is that the listening experience changes over time.  After repeated listening the songs that initially grabbed your attention now seem somewhat flat and predictable, and it's other songs from the record that grow into true favourites.  [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10AlbumsOf08/VampireWeekend_IStandCorrected.mp3]

[![seldomseenkid_cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/seldomseenkid_cover.jpg?w=96)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/seldomseenkid_cover.jpg)7. **_The Seldom Seen Kid_ by Elbow**.  I guess this is the only properly Radio 1 friendly record on this list, and as a rule I normally try to steer clear of all the populist nonsense that those peddlers of filth and payola try to ram down our throats.  Sadly I was sucked in, but not really with any regret, as this album is quite deserving of all the accolades that have been heaped upon it.  It contains no great songs as such, but the sheer quality of the production (all done by the band themselves) more than takes the load.

[![poormansheaven_cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/poormansheaven_cover.jpg?w=96)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/poormansheaven_cover.jpg)6. **_Poor Man's Heaven_ by Seth Lakeman**.  Seized upon by the Radio 2 folky brigade following his Mercury nomination for _Kitty Jay_, Lakeman had been threatening to become successful for ages, but was held back by the sorely disappointing _Freedom Fields_ (his second album, and the first to be made since he came into the public eye).  Poor Man's Heaven is by no means Lakeman's magnum opus (I believe his best work is still to come), he has finally delivered on all the potential he displayed in his first album.  Bad news for agoraphobes, however, as Lakeman is only truly in his element when seen live, when the songs are injected with far more energy and passion than he is capable of delivering in the studio.

[![fallingoffthelavenderbridge_cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/fallingoffthelavenderbridge_cover.jpg?w=96)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/fallingoffthelavenderbridge_cover.jpg)5. **_Falling off the Lavender Bridge_ by Lightspeed Champion**.  Another act that showed great promise early in the year, Lightspeed Champion, a.k.a. Dev Hynes (né Test Icicles) was the darling of the music press (particularly the NME) when he released a series of free-to-download EPs from his [website](http://lightspeedchampion.com/index.html).  The album proper was produced in Omaha by Mike Mogis (of Bright Eyes fame) who is a god in my eyes, so I was sure I was going to love it.  Despite, or maybe because of, all this expectation, on first listening I was left a little wanting.  The standout songs (of which there are quite a few) seemed to be quite sparse on the ground.  After about a week of repeat listening, however, the album began to coalesce into a definite set; that is, the songs _worked_ as an album, and I'd strongly recommend that this record be listened to from start to finish.

[![alarum_cover2](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/alarum_cover2.jpg?w=96)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/alarum_cover2.jpg)4. **_A Larum_ by Johnny Flynn (& the Sussex Wit)**. Full of all the Shakespearean, archaic turns of phrase that one would expect from a dedicated thespian (Flynn is a regular touring actor and fell into music almost by accident) this album was released in a blaze of absolutely no publicity at all.  Many of the songs had been kicking around on mp3 blogs for a while before the record was released (the Sussex Wit was dropped from the moniker for the official release, but the band playing on the record is still the same group of players).  As a result you can get almost the whole record for free, which has obviously harmed the CD's sales as I imagine readers of music blogs would be Johnny's core fan base.

[![Pissing/Kissing cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/meursault_pissingkissingcover2.jpg?w=96)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/meursault_pissingkissingcover2.jpg)3. **_Pissing on Bonfires/Kissing With Tongues_ by Meursault**. I reviewed this record quite recently, so I shan't blather on about it too much here.  Needless to say it's pretty damn super, and your lives will all be enhanced greatly by its presence in your life. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10AlbumsOf08/Meursault_TheFurnace.mp3]

[![angles_cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/angles_cover.jpg?w=96)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/angles_cover.jpg)2. **_Angles_ by Dan Le Sac Vs Scroobius Pip**.  This record puts me _completely_ out of my comfort zone.  British Hip-Hop (is that what the kids are calling it these days?) has never been my first choice of listening material, but I stumbled across the _Thou Shalt Always Kill_ single a year or so ago, and loved it so much that when this album came out I bought it straight away.  If I'm honest I was expecting little more than a mildly diverting comedy record, but _Angles_ is so much more than that.  Engaging and effecting in equal measure, this is a rare album that delivers on virtually every front.

[![foremma_cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/foremma_cover.jpg?w=96)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/foremma_cover.jpg)1. **_For Emma, Forever Ago_ by Bon Iver**.  This one will be on everyone's end of year lists, but deservedly so, as it's the best album I've heard in ages.  All the hype and praise still hasn't spoilt the listening experience, which is a danger with universally loved records. As a result of its success there's not all that much left for me to say about it, other than that if you haven't heard it yet then you really should.  [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10AlbumsOf08/BonIver_SkinnyLove.mp3]
