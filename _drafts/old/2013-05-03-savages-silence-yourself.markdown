There are plenty of instances where I've been swept along with everyone else when the hype machine**†** rolls into town. For instance, everyone loves **Chvrches**, and I too love **Chvrches**. There are also a number of occasions where I've vehemently disagreed with popular opinion only to later have a change of heart and concede that, actually, all the fuss was justified. Everyone loved **Daughter** when I thought little of them, now I've turned full circle and [can't get enough of them](http://eatenbymonsters/review/daughter-if-you-leave/). The gist of my point is that my tastes are not all that different from the mainstream (and by ‘mainstream’ I mean the oxymoronic _alternative_ mainstream; all that X-factor/pop-charts-nonsense can take a hike).

Where the blogosphere and I differ drastically, however, is on the issue of **Savages**. The consensus view – even amongst the select cadré of [blogs that I read regularly and who's opinion I respect](http://17seconds.co.uk/blog/2013/05/01/album-review-savages/) – seems to be that they're the best thing since sliced bread, and in all honesty I think their music is just plain awful. Their debut album **Silence Yourself** – which comes out on May **6th** but can be [streamed in full on the band's website](http://silenceyourself.savagesband.com/) already – is a hulking mass of early-eighties new-wave cliché and pastiche. There's no denying it's a strong aesthetic, and when taken as a set of ingredients it can produce wonders in the right hands. **Savages**, alas, are far from the right hands; their efforts sound clunky and derivative and are far from the sum of their parts.

**2013** is proving itself to be a vintage year for indie music, with a plethora of fantastic singles, **EP**s, and albums released already. Why are so many people raving about **Savages** when there's a wealth of better music to be getting excited about?! It seems incomprehensible. My advice, then, is to steer well clear of **Silence Yourself**, and instead pick almost any other release of the past four months – you're guaranteed that _whatever_ you choose will be many times better than this weak effort.



**†** Note the lower case.
