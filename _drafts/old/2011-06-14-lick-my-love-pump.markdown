[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/picture-1.png?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/picture-1.png)When in the company rock musicians it is often hard to avoid thinking of Rob Reiner's fantastic mockumentary, or 'Rockumentary', _This is Spinal Tap_.  The film so accurately parodied the attitude of all those who think they're rock stars that even now, 26 years later, it's next to impossible to find a band who haven't been guilty of at least a few Tapisms.  What I should have realised, of course, is that the satire and parody of Spinal Tap is equally applicable to all walks of musical life.

While listening to an interview with William Bennett I was struck by the similarity to the scene in Tap where the lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel, played exquisitely by Christopher Guest, is being interviewed while playing a piano piece he had written.  The interviewer, played by Reiner himself in the guise of director Marty DiBergi, compliments Tufnel on the beauty of the piece, and the guitarist then extols on how it was written as part of a trilogy of works far loftier in scope and ambition than Tap's usual fare, and says how he sees himself compositionally as sitting between Bach and Mozart.  "What do you call this piece?" asks DiBergi, and without missing a beat, and perfectly deadpan, Tufnel replies, "This piece is called _Lick My Love Pump_."

The part that had me doubled over with laughter (not something you want to be doing too often when your walls are as thin as mine) was about five-and-a-half minutes in, when after a lengthy explanation of his artistic method and expectations from listeners, he calmly, and without any apparent sense of mockery, introduces one of his tracks as, and I quote, _Dumping the Fucking Rubbish_.

I've included the interview below (with the tracks removed, sadly), so I recommend that you listen to it, and absorb Bennett's calm, rational, charismatic discourse on his art, then listen to the track in question (also included below).  Bennett is, to all outside observers, totally serious, yet I can't help but wonder if this softly-spoken man has to fight the urge to burst into howls of laughter every time someone else takes it seriously...
