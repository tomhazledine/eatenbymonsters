[![Little Green Cars live](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/little-green-cars-300x300.jpg)](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/2012/12/10/bbc-sound-of-2013-longlist/little-green-cars/#main)Today the BBC announced the longlist for their [annual 'Sound Of...' poll of critics and tastemakers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010q6bc/profiles/thelonglist). As expected, there's little difference between this 15 and the Blog Sound of 2013 announced last week. Mercifully for all concerned, there are at least a couple of differences; mercifully for the Blog Sound list because if they were both exactly the same then the Blog list would be rendered redundant, and mercifully for us music fans because this list is a little better.

I say a _little_ better, mind. The vast majority of both lists is in my considered opinion utter dross, but at least that has the effect of highlighting the bands that actually are good. The Blog list had Randolph's Leap, and while they're sadly missing from the Beeb's list, Auntie has redeemed herself a little with the inclusion of the frankly excellent [Little Green Cars](http://www.facebook.com/littlegreencars). There not a band I've heard of before today, but their track _John Wayne_ is pure indie-pop perfection.

Elsewhere on the list, things aren't looking so good, but while I can't say I like King Krule or Kodaline or Peace or Palma Violets, at least they're real bands. I'm not at all keen on the music the make, but unlike the majority of this list (and all but 3 of the Blogs' list) I don't _hate_ their music (well, maybe a case could be made for Palma Violets being hateful, but that's a whole other post).

What is immediately apparent, though, is that in terms of catchy songs and attitude and sheer slickness of presentation, Chvrches are head and shoulders above the rest of the pack. Their aesthetic is a little out of my comfort zone, and the fella's voice isn't as slick as the girls, but they certainly know what they're doing when it comes to managing their PR and I reckon they're going to be absolutely massive in 2013.

You can see the live video of that [Chvrches performance on the BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0127ym9). I had embedded it here, but it turned out the Beeb's video player insisted on autoplaying, and was summarily deleted.
