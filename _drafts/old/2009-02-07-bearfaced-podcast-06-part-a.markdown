I'm sure you'll all be overjoyed to hear that I've finally found the time to record another episode of the [Bearfaced Podcast](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#podcasts), and what's more I had so much to talk about that it had to be split into two parts.Â  Next week I'll release _Part "B"_ which will be a live session and interview with [Tom Stephens and the Retreat](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/ep-tom-stephens-and-the-retreat/), but this week I've concerned myself with the up-coming releases that are getting all of us at Bearfaced Towers hot under the collar.

A lot of the songs I play in this 'cast are mostly from recent blog posts (as they're the ones I'm most excited about at the moment) but there's a few other treats in there for your listening pleasure.

You can download the 'cast directly from [its page on the Bearfaced website](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#tagged/?id=83), or if you'd rather subscribe (as I do) you can easily find it in iTunes by searching for "Bearfaced Podcast".
