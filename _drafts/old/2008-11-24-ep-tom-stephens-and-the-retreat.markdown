[![Tom Stephens and the Retreat](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/tomstephens1.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/tomstephens1.jpg)Anyone for some Alternative Rock? A genre many thought had died out at the end of the '90s seems to be going through a bit of a resurgence lately.  The (really, really, really awfully named) Royworld seem to be doing alright for themselves, and now [Tom Stephens and the Retreat](http://www.myspace.com/tomstephensandtheretreat) have stepped manfully into the arena.  They'd probably be appalled at this pigeonholing, but I honestly can't think of a better "label" for the thoughtful, gutsy rock that these guys are peddling.

Having only recently acquired a copy of their current EP, I have to say they're much better when seen live and, more importantly, loud.  In the flesh, they sound much bigger and fuller than a four-piece has any right to.  With so many bands at the moment wearing their indie/nu-rave/whatever credentials on their sleeves, I must say it's refreshing to see some clean-cut, straight-down-the-middle rock music.
