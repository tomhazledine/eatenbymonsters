I've been wrestling with charges of being a "music snob" lately, so here's one last retrospective list. This one's built to show that while there's not often much evidence of it on this site, I do actually have something of a soft spot for pop junk. In my darkest hours I do find myself turning to the likes of Dire Straits and Crowded House and The Eagles, and this year has added a few more tracks to what I euphemistically call my 'guilty pleasures' playlist.

## 5. The Boxer - Mumford & Sons feat. Jerry Douglas


This one ticks all the boxes: lap-steel slide guitar virtuoso? Check! The anthemic folk-lite of the Mumfords? Check! Cover of a classic guilty pleasure? Check! In fact, revisit the original Boxer if you get the time; it really is magnificent, even if Simon et al do lay it on a bit thick...

## 4. Painting - Mammal Club


I can't abide falsetto, and hate the idea of anyone even _thinking_ I like it. Yet This one shouts down the voices of my better angels just as surely as Sparks managed with _This Town Ain't Big Enough For The Both Of Us_.

## 3.Once And For All - Clock Opera


There's a certain style of Radio-2-friendly pop-rock that makes my skin crawl, yet every now and again I feel myself being pulled toward it with inexorable inevitability. It happened with Royworld back in '08, and it happened again this year with Clock Opera.

## 2. We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together - Taylor Swift


This is the first (and most likely the last) Taylor Swift song I've ever heard, and while it doesn't inspire me to investigate her back-catalogue further it is nevertheless a catchy and witty little tune. I say little, but it's clearly been built for stadium shows and has a list of writers as long as my arm. Either way, it's good to see that the ghost of early-Avril-Lavigne pseudo-country-pop-rock still lives on.

## 1. Call Me Maybe - Carly Rae Jepsen


I've still never heard a single bar of Justin Beiber's musical output, but I'm told he plucked little Ms. Jepsen from obscurity on the basis of this masterful piece of pop workmanship. Maybe I should take the time to explore some of his oeuvre...
