[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/frightenedrabbit_daytrotter.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/frightenedrabbit_daytrotter.jpg)Ah, as the release date for _A Winter of Mixed Drinks_ fast approaches (March 1st) we're being treated to yet more [Frightened Rabbit](http://www.myspace.com/frightenedrabbit) goodness.  The band have released the album track _Fun Stuff_ for fans to download, and there's now also a competition (gosh, how exciting!).

_Fun Stuff_ first emerged last year when a demo titled _Last Tango in Brooklyn_ started doing the rounds.  Other than the change of name, there's not much that's changed in the song - the production on this new version is just a bit slicker, as one would expect from an album cut.  As a song, it's what we've come to expect from Hutchison & co. Bitter and acerbic, after the lairy roustabouts that were the previous two singles, _Swim Until You Can't See Land_ and _[Nothing Like You](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/nothing-like-you-frightened-rabbit/)_, it's nice to hear hints of the softer touch that made _[Midnight Organ Fight](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/the-midnight-organ-fight-frightened-rabbit/)_ such a lasting success.

As for the competition, head over to the band's [Muzu channel](http://www.muzu.tv/frightenedrabbit/?country=gb) for the full lowdown (as well as a few FR videos too).  Submit a cocktail recipe (see what they did there?) by the 15th Feb. to be in with a chance of winning free FR gig tickets and an after-show drink with the band.

*From a [Daytrotter session](http://www.daytrotter.com/dt/frightened-rabbit-concert/20030309-3737635.html) they did back in '08, just to bulk the post up a bit.
