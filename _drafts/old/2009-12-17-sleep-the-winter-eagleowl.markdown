[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/eagleowl_sleepthewinter_flyer.jpg)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/eagleowl_sleepthewinter_flyer.jpg)I first featured scotch "low-fi post punk" outfit [eagleowl](http://www.eagleowlattack.co.uk/) (note the deliberate lowercase "e") on this blog over a year ago, when I reviewed their debut EP _[For the Thoughts You Never Had](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/11/22/for-the-thoughts-you-never-had-eagleowl/).  After the success of For the Thoughts... it could be seen as surprising that over twelve months later all they've released is this new single, Sleep the Winter, but as far as I can tell this fits in perfectly with the band's overarching mission.  As with the last EP, Sleep the Winter is all about taking your time, and while this record comes across as a somewhat more lush affair than their last outing the emphasis is still on the space in the music._

_And what beautiful space it is.  Plenty of bands indulge in seasonally themed releases - and at Christmas more than ever - but they more often than not come across as half-cocked, half-baked ventures.  eagleowl have overcome this hurdle magnificently; Sleep the Winter is perfectly tailored for nights in by a roaring fire and the evocative soundscapes they craft instantly transport you to whatever your idea of a winter wonderland might be._

I've included a download of the B-side, Laughter, which is excellent, but I urge you to get hold of a copy so you can hear the title track which is even better.
