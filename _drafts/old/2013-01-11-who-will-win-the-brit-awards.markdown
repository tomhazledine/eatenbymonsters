[![Brit Awards Logo](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BritAwardsLogo2013-300x209.jpg)](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/?attachment_id=1559#main)Well the nominations are out, and while I don't normally go in for this kind of prediction I figured I may as well take a stab at guessing who the eventual winners will be.

In short, I think Alt-J will sweep the board, pipping bookies-favourite Emeli Sandé to the coveted Best Album gong. That said, Jessie Ware might beat them to Best Breakthrough. Their latest LP _Babel_ bored me to tears, but I'd never bet against the Mumford's in a live setting, and while I'm loath to overlook The Boss, I think Gotye might beat both him and Jack White for International Male.

We'll find out if I'm anywhere near the mark when the winners are announced on the 20th February's ceremony at the O2, hosted by James Corden and featuring live performances by Muse, Robbie Williams, Emeli Sandé, Mumford & Sons, Ben Howard and One Direction (oh, the unbridled joy!). It's usually a train-wreck of broadcast, so well worth watching just for the sheer schadenfreude of it all.
