As promised, here's the shortlist for the Blog Sound of 2012.  While the BBC's poll, which inspired this alternative list, will be announced by a suspense-inducing day-by-day countdown, us humble bloggers are releasing our top five all in one go.  In the interests of full disclosure, I should say now that none of these five acts were voted for by me, and I hadn't even heard of Daughter or Theme Park before the longlist announcement.  Nevertheless, I have been doing my homework on behalf of the blog - tirelessly and giving no quarter - and shall be reporting back soon with posts on all the best acts from the longlist.  Until then, here's the Blog Sound of 2012 shortlist:
