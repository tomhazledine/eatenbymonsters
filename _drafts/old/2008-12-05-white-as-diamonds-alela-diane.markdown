![aleladiane_live](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/aleladiane_live.jpg?w=213)Alela's song _The Rifle_ has been a favorite of the missus' ever since it was an iTunes Single of the Week back in March, and now it seems there's an album on the way, entitled _To Be Still_.  In advance of that, she (or at least her new record label, the inimitable [Rough Trade](http://www.roughtrade.com/site/shop_detail.lasso?search_type=sku&sku=280996)) has released _White as Diamonds_ as a preview.

Sadly it seems she succumbed to the need to slap unnecessary bass and drums all over her sparse, countryish tunes.  I guess that's one of the pitfalls of signing to a large label: you get given some actual money to make a recording, and feel that you need to deliver something more "expansive" to warrant the expense...

Thankfully she's done a [Daytrotter session](http://www.daytrotter.com/article/739/free-songs-alela-diane) sans drums etc, and it sounds much better, and much more in keeping with her style.  I've included the [Daytrotter](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/11/04/daytrotter-a-profile/) version of The Rifle below, along with the promotional copy of White as Diamonds, but to get a true feel for what she's capable of you should definately peruse the Daytrotter tracks.  You can get her previous self/tiny-label releases from [her wesite](http://www.aleladiane.com/cdmp3.html), and I'm guessing the new record'll be all over the shops when it gets released...
