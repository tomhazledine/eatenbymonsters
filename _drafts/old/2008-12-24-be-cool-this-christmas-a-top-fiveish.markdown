![really bad](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/really_bad.jpg)

Things have been pretty quiet round here lately, owing to all the joys of preparing for Christmas that have (quite rightly) kept me away from the 'puter.  So to atone for having missed a Wednesday Top Five I've compiled a bumper Christmas Top Ten for your festive enjoyment:

10. **_I Believe in Father Christmas_ by Greg Lake**.  I don't know how the rest of you feel, but whilst I tolerate (and on occasion actively enjoy) the cheesy Crimbo-Pop that_ always_ does the rounds at this time of year, I can't say I think of any of them as being actual music.  There are three of them that I do like, however, and this is the first.  I'm most definitely not an Emerson, Lake & Palmer fan, but there's something about the slow crescendo and haunting 12-string of this piece that elevates it above the muck and mire of other "Christmas Classics".

9. **_Fairytale of New York_ by the Pogues (feat. Kirsty MacColl)**.  _Yes_ he's a genius, and _yes_ by rights this should be at the top of the list.  But I'm growing sick-to-death of _everyone_ saying those exact same things without any thought at all.  And it's become the "cool" Christmas song, which automatically diminishes it in my eyes. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/ThePogues_FairytaleOfNewYork.mp3]

8. **_Everything's Gonna be Cool this Christmas_ by Eels**.  "Baby Jesus; born to rock!" 'Nuf said... [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/Eels_EverythingsGonnaBeCoolThisChristmas.mp3]

7. **_Please Daddy (Don't Get Drunk this Christmas)_ by the Decemberists**.  Despite being overtly comical and a less-than-subtle lampooning of country music, this one still has a gentle appeal, if only because it has the best title of any Christmas song. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/TheDecemberists_PleaseDaddyDontGetDrunkThisChristmas.mp3]

6. **_On Christmas Day_ by Spiers & Boden**.  Here's a traditional english pastoral number in keeping with the true spirit of Christmas. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/SpiersAndBoden_OnChristmasDay.mp3]

5. **_Ukranian Bell Carol _performed by George Winston**.  I know it's cheesy American-lite clean piano lounge music, but George Winston's _December_ album is as much a part of advent at casa EbM as _Carols from King's. _The _Bell Carol_ is also christmasy all by itself. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/GeorgeWinston_CarolOfTheBells.mp3]

4. **_Christmas Day_ by Jim White**.  Haunting and uplifting in equal measure, this Jim White tune is an absolute gem.  It also makes for a welcome change in mood from the rest of the sickeningly upbeat Christmas milieu. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/JimWhite_ChristmasDay.mp3]

3. **_God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen_ by Bright Eyes**.  And here's another change in mood; Conor's esoteric delivery makes for a somewhat raucous carol. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/BrightEyes_GodRestYeMerryGentlemen.mp3]

2. **_The Christmas Song_ by Nat King Cole**. It seems an awful lot of what makes a "traditional" Christmas is of yank origin: the Coca-Cola-red Father Christmas, overblown light displays, almost all the films, etc. and I have to say most of it comes across as sickly-sweet and overly sentimental.  Good ol' Nat is no exception, but if you're going to have an American Christmas you may as well do it with style - and that means crooners aplenty. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/NatKingCole_TheChristmasSong.mp3]

1. **_Lonely this Christmas_ by Mud**.  This Elvis pastiche never ceases to bring a smile to my face.  Glam Rock sucked (fact!) but I'm willing to forgive Mud of all evils on account of this terifically dry and terribly funny Christmas classic. [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Top10Christmas/Mud_LonelyThisChristmas.mp3]
