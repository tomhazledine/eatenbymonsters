![layabout](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/layabout.jpg?w=228)I get the impression that this one landed in my inbox as a result of my prattling on about how great Ben Folds used to be.  In my experience (which is admittedly limited owing to the fact that I live in England, where Folds-fans are comparatively thin on the ground) a shared enthusiasm for _Whatever and Ever, Amen_ is a surefire way to get a free CD off someone.  And in such cases what you invariably end up hearing is almost exactly what you'd expect: MOR piano-rock, with occasionally witty, somewhat acerbic lyrics.

LA based band [Layabout](http://www.myspace.com/layabout) are no exception.  Perhaps lacking the depth and lyrical range of Folds himself, the _Suburban Legend_ EP certainly delivers on an if-you-like-that-you'll-like-this level, whilst bringing enough new elements to the table to keep things interesting; they're coming at the formula from a somewhat "lounge" angle, if you get my meaning.

If I'm honest, Layabout are a bit too "smooth" for my tastes.  I only like Folds when he displays a bit of biting edginess, and given the evidence here I'd say that Layabout haven't found that quite yet.

Layabout - [Arms Around the City](http://www.layaboutband.com/av/arms_around_the_city_by_layabout.mp3) [audio http://www.layaboutband.com/av/arms_around_the_city_by_layabout.mp3]

You can hear a few more tracks and buy the EP from the [Layabout website](http://www.layaboutband.com/), but be forewarned: it's fully of clunky Adobe Flash.
