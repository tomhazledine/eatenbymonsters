_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

Christmas is a time when my rational, atheist mind turns to mush when confronted with all the trappings of the season.  Thick dripping candles, vaulted ceilings, and the sheer power of carols that have been hardwired into my brain from an early age all come together to leave me very confused indeed.  It's in that spirit that I find the [Branches](http://www.myspace.com/soundslikebranches) adaptation of _O Come All Ye Faithful_ (taken from their new EP _Merry Christmas_, available for [free download](http://soundslikebranches.bandcamp.com/album/merry-christmas)) intensely haunting, despite the god-fearing, exultant nature of the lyrical content.
