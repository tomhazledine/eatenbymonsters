Pitched in the under-explored middle-ground between Mogwai and Yann Tiersen, **[haiku salut](http://haikusalut.com/)** are a trio of Darbishire lasses with a mesmerizing sonic palate and a distinct francophile sensibility. And if the menu on their homepage is anything to go by they've got a good eye for a bad pun, too, which makes me like them even more.

There's an album in the works, called **'tricolore'** and [out in March](http://www.howdoesitfeel.co.uk/haikushop.html), but as a tantalizing foretaste they're giving away their track [**'los elefantes**' as a free download](http://www.howdoesitfeel.co.uk/hdiflabel.html).
