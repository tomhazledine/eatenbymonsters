[](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/20101115_isingthebodyeclectic_header02.jpg)Tomorrow I embark on my most daunting critical venture yet: I’m becoming a dee-jay.  Tune in to [Wired Radio](http://www.wiredradio.co.uk/) tomorrow night and you’ll find me presenting my very own live-to-air radio show.  You may or may not be aware that I present a semi-regular podcast for the super-cool, super-small, super-indie label [Bearfaced Records](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/), but they are all recorded and put together before hand; this will be a different kettle of fish entirely.  For every minute of speech on a [Bearfaced Podcast](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#podcasts)there’s usually at least half and hour’s worth of stuff on the cutting room floor, so trying to get my head around the discipline of a live broadcast is going to be challenging, to say the least.  Add in the fact that I’ve never even seen the studio I’ll be using before, let alone knowing how the gear works, and you’ve got a sure fire recipe for disaster.  Hilarious consequence, as they say, will surely ensue…

So in order to snatch triumph from the jaws of disaster I’m doing my damnedest to make sure my first playlist is absolutely marvellous.  The way I see it, if I keep the talking to a minimum and simply play great songs then hopefully the opportunities for it to all go pear-shaped will be few and far between.  That’s the plan anyway; as we all know, a plan is just a list of things that don’t happen.  So wish me luck, and tune in at 9pm (English time) to hear what could be a glorious victory or an abject disaster.  Either way it’ll surely be entertaining…

The show will be called _I Sing the Body Eclectic_ (see what I did there? Clever, eh!) and while I'll most likely post the odd reminder on these pages, I'll provide more info (playlists, comments etc) on a new blog created solely for the purpose, which you can find [here](http://isingthebodyeclectic.wordpress.com/).
