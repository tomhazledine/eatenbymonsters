[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/wearescientists_barbara.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/wearescientists_barbara.jpg)I've taken a lot of flack in the past for liking We Are Scientists.  I'm often derided by my close friends when I mention in conversation that I think _With Love and Squalor_ is a great album.  It's an opinion I still stand by, but it's increasingly the case that when I talk about it I have to add a whole lot of caveats and explanations - "just their first album", "I only like their early stuff", "I know, I know; the new stuff's dreadful", and so on and so forth.  I'm a man who enjoys standing up for overlooked records that haven't gotten all the respect they're due, but I've reached the point with We Are Scientists where it's just become far too much hassle to stand up for them.

I mean, they really haven't done themselves any favours, have they? 2008's _Brain Thrust Mastery_ wasn't actually a bad album as such, but it certainly wasn't a good one either.  _After Hours_ was a nice single, _Impatience_ had a [great video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH-RG1lWc0I), and_ Spoken For_ harkened back to some of the softer moments from their (major label) debut, but nothing on there came even close to setting the world alight.  It was clear by this point that I liked the idea of We Are Scientists far more that I liked the actual music; they look really cool, the overall sound gives off an air of thoughtful, studied nonchalance and they give the impression that I'd really like them if we were to meet in the pub.

Now, with this year's new album _Barbara_ on the scene, I've given up entirely.  If _Brain Thrust Mastery_ sounded like off-cuts and B-sides from _With Love and Squalor_, _Barbara_ is even more so.  To my ears there has been absolutely no sonic development whatsoever since their debut.  _BTM_ added some acoustic guitars and synths to the mix, but the songwriting, both on _BTM_ and now with _Barbara_, seemed to be coming from exactly the same place as their previous work.  I'm all in favour of consistency, and if they'd made two new LPs at the standard of _WLaS_ then they'd most likely be one of my favourite bands by now, but sadly it's looking ever more likely that their first record was a flash in the pan, a one off never to be repeated.

I almost feel bad including mp3s with this post; it's just so bland.  It feels half-baked, underdeveloped; only half the tracks on this LP manage to survive past the three minute mark, and most only by a whisker, and rather than feeling like a focused, .  But, (and this will probably be the last time I can be bother to stick my neck out and say this) go and listen to With Love and Squalor; it's a paragon of indie-pop that's absolutely stuffed with great songs.
