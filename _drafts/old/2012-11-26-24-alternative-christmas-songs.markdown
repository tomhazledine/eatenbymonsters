Plenty of people despise Christmas music. I, for my sins, am not one of them. I'm a real sucker for a good bit of seasonal merriment,  and it seems so are a lot of you. My Christmas posts are always popular, so last year I treated you all to an [advent-style rundown of some of my favourite 'alternative' Christmas classics](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/category/alternative-christmas/). For those of you who missed it last year, or who merely want a handy refresher, here's that list in a handy condensed form.

I'm sure that this won't be my last cashing-in-on-holiday-fever post, but I doubt I'll do a full scale count down like last year. While I love Christmas songs dearly, and there seem to be a awful lot of them out there, the number of them that are actually _good_ is sadly finite. Last year I claimed that these were the best ones out there and while one or two new hits may emerge this year, there certainly won't be enough good ones to justify another list of this scale. So, without further ado, here's twenty four of the best alternative Christmas songs out there:

Master Slash Slave - [All I Want For Christmas](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Christmas/MasterSlashSlave_AllIWantForChristmas.mp3) [audio http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/EbMBlog_mp3s/Christmas/MasterSlashSlave_AllIWantForChristmas.mp3]

[![](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/st-nicholas-day-massacre-300x300.jpg)](http://www.eatenbymonsters.com/?attachment_id=1382#main)All the songs on this list are at worst seasonally entertaining, and often pretty good regardless of the time of year, but the select few that follow have risen to a higher level. One benefit of a good Christmas song is that it is infinitely re-usable. At the core of this phenomenon is that at this time of year we're far more willing to be generous to songs that would, in other circumstances, sound dated or trashy. We'll throw caution and taste to the wind precisely because we know they'll be safely locked away again come december 24th. This next selection of songs, however, I wish I could listen to all year round (although, of course, I can't). The Withered Hand offering, in particular, represents the peak of an exceptional career.
