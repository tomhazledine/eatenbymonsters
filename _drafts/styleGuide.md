## Style Guide for Eaten by Monsters Copy

* 20150326

**Bold text** signifies **small caps** when used on the eatenbymonsters.com domain.

Band names should be written in **bold**, name of artistic works should be written in *italics*.
The names of people should be written normally except when they are an artist who trades under their own name, in which case their name is their band name and should be written in **bold**.

Names of organisations (companies, record labels, etc.) should be written normally, and names of their products (events, publications, services, etc.) should be *italicised*.

Copy should ideally be run through the Hemingway app to check for *passive voice*, but long sentences and complex vocabulary are to be encouraged (even though Hemingway would not approve).

Arabic numerals (**0**–**9**) should be written in **bold** (because the small caps font includes old-style/text figures), except when used as tabular data.

### Misc Grammar rules
