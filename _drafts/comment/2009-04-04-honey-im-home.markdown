Of the many items in my inbox, it's about a half-and-half split between soulless press releases and more personal appeals for attention. I can't speak for any other bloggers, and certainly not for any real journalists, but I despise press releases with a passion. Don't get me wrong, I make an effort to listen to all the stuff I'm sent regardless of how it's presented, but a bad press release can have a considerable effect of my first impressions of the music. It's shallow of me, I'll admit, but it's the truth. The submissions that _do_ grab my attention are always the more personal ones.

Now by "personal" I don't merely mean that they're addressed to me; since the advent of automated mailing list software this has ceased to mean anything. Nor do I expect to receive a **100%** unique email; If you're promoting your band properly then you'll be emailing loads of different people and can't realistically be expected to attend to every single blog on an individual basis.

What I look for in a submission is simply good copy. I want to read something that's been written by a human being, not a PR machine. For the love of god you should avoid cliché like the plague [sic]. A little hyperbole is to be expected - these bands are selling themselves, after all - but meaningless phrases and trite comparisons instantly cheapen the experience for a reviewer.

I'm not exactly a huge outfit myself (insert scathing waistline joke here), and I'm not looking to write about huge arena-filling bands. Honesty and enthusiasm always shine through in submissions, no matter how "unprofessional" they may appear.
