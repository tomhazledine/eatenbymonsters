Eaten by Monsters is in a state of flux right now. We're transitioning to a new design, a new technical back-end, and a new content structure. This means a few popular pages will be missing for a few weeks.

If you're looking for alternative Christmas music, pop back in a week or so and we'll have re-instated our archive of awesome non-standard Christmas songs.

The same goes for our yearly "Top Ten" lists of the best albums and songs. These will all return shortly.
