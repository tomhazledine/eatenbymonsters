![Inbetweens EP cover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/withered-hand-inbetweens.png)

Moving on from all the **7**"s that have been covered on these pages lately, here's a **10**" **EP** from **EbM** favourites **Withered Hand**. While the last **WH** release - the [_Heart Heart_](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/heart-heart-withered-hand/) **7**" that came out in Feb. - represented a new direction for Dan Wilson's project, _Inbetweens_ is more representative of **Withered Hand's** general sound. What I've always loved about **WH**, and which was perhaps slightly lacking in _Heart Heart_, is his ability to take the generic setup of acoustic guitar and crackly voice and turn it into something ultimately rather esoteric. Aside from his distinctive voice, there's nothing overtly groundbreaking in the aesthetics of WH's recorded output, but it does serve as a fine canvas to perfectly showcase the quality of the songwriting; to the point where his  **2009** **LP** has been slowly creeping to the top of my all-time favourite albums list.

The title track on _Inbetweens_ might not be WH's best work, but it is nevertheless very good indeed, and it's been my experience that **WH** songs tend to be 'growers', so come back in six months and this track may be a firm favorite.  Where this **EP** gets interesting for me as a **WH** fan is the **B**-side, where some old songs are revisited. If you include **Meursault's** cover, this is the fifth recorded version of _Oldsmobile Car_ (which I know better as _Red Candle Bulb_) that I've heard, and up until now every version has had some flaw or quirk in it that renders it slightly less than a finished product. That might have been a dodgy drum machine or some ever dodgier backing vocals ("shooby-shooby"?!), but I'm pleased to report that this version gives the song the treatment it has so long deserved.

More controversial, in my eyes, is the final track, _(it's a) Wonderful Lie_. Originally released as a Christmas song in **2007**, the song was so good that Dan changed a verse to make it less season-specific and incorporated it into his live shows. This is a recording of that version complete with fleshed-out instrumentation, and it is very, very good. What makes it sit uneasily with me is that it's not quite as good as the original festive version. I'm willing to accept that this might be because I have a strong emotional attachment to the old version - I've listened to it countless hundreds of times in the fortnightly period in which it's acceptable to listen to Christmas songs - but secretly I'm sure it's because the older version actually _is_ better.

All in all, this **10**" has much to recommend it, both to **Withered Hand** fanboy completists and casual admirers of really great music. Go buy it!
