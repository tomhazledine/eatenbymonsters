National Anthem are clearly a project to keep a weather-eye on. Flushed with their end-of-year successes with Haim and Chvrches, the boutique singles label have now secured the release of an **EP** by Aussie duo **[Atlas Genius](http://www.atlasgenius.com/)**. The song *Trojans* itself has gained quite a bit of traction state-side, and the band will be releasing their debut long-player at the end of the month. A couple of days before that, however, you can get the **UK** release of the track on it's own **EP** from the National Anthem website.

If ridiculously expensive limited-edition vinyl releases are your thing (and they certainly are mine) then the **NA** page is definitely one to add to your bookmarks, but you need to be quick - the **Haim** and **Chvrches** records are all sold-out, and I imagine the **Atlas Genius** record may go the same way in double quick time. This is indie electro-pop at its very best; a little slice of summer to stave off the hail and sleet.
