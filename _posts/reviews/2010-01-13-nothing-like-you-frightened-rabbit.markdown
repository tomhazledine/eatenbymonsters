This time last year the musical calendar was looking pretty darned exciting. With albums on the horizon by EbM favourites **Broken Records**, **Emmy the Great**, frYars, **Esser** and **The Decemberists** I was expecting great things of **2009**. Sure enough, **2009** produced some great records and was an all-round "good year for music", but strangely none of the albums I was so excited about delivered on expectations. All the aforementioned albums were _good_, but none of them were great, and certainly nowhere near as good as we'd all hoped they would be; hype is truly a terrible thing.

So it is with great trepidation and wariness that I nail my colours to the mast and say that I am really, really looking forward to the upcoming **Frightened Rabbit** album, _The Winter of Mixed Drinks_. Of course this will come as no surprise to regular readers who probably have some inkling as to [how much I love FR](/quietly-now-frightened-rabbit/). It seems like this album may be very well timed, as **FR** did very well in quite a few end-of-decade lists (such as the *NME's* and *The Skinny's*) and fans have been kept interested throughout **2009** first by the excellent _Quietly Now!_ (a live version of _Midnight Organ Fight_) and the pre-Christmas single _Swim Until You Can't See Land_. This single was our first taste of what to expect from the upcoming album, and very nice it was too. Now we're being further tempted by another single, _Nothing Like You_.

This one won't be released until the **22nd** Feb and normally I'd hold off on a review until closer to the release date, but being as the album proper comes out only a few days later (**1st** March) I can justify getting this one out a little early (and it also shows how cool I must be to be able to get my paws on the single this far ahead of it's release...\*cough\*cough\*). The **B**-side, _Learned Your Name_, is a gentle, sombre affair, trundling along nicely without sparking too much excitement; but then that's all you ought to expect from a **B**-side. The **A**-side, however, is a different story.

With all the great (possibly dangerous?) hype the band have been getting lately, and given the success of _Swim..._, all this single really needs to do is make sure it doesn't disappoint. Regardless, _Nothing Like You_ springs from the blocks like it's got something to prove. It rattles along at a furious pace and does it's job admirably - it's more than equal to the quality of the work on *Midnight Organ Fight*, while at the same time pointing at yet more to come. To hell with my trepidation, **2010** should be fantastic!
