Here's a new single that quickly rose to the top of my inbox. A four-piece from Norwich, **Port Isla** peddle a rather pleasing mix of Appalachian-inspired folksy harmonies and persuasive pop sensibility. Their single *Sinking Ship*Â has been released as a free download from Soundcloud, and is really rather special.

For the opening few bars I was a little worried that the band was just one guy and a loopstation trying to sound like **KT Tunstall**, but there is [documentary evidence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f89GejDxAA4&feature=plcp) that this is a _real_ band. And besides, once the chorus kicks in any similarities are quickly forgotten; this track has an energy and momentum that is all its own. The basic sound on offer here is one that's very _in vogue_ these days, but **Port Isla** add enough of their own ideas to keep it fresh and intriguing. At the risk of making trite comparisons, imagine if **Robin Pecknold** actually liked music, had a decent drummer, and was more interested in rocking out than appearing fey and ethereal. That's **Port Isla**.

Aside from this single, there's some good stuff to be found on [the band's Soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/port-isla/tracks), and I'd imagine there's plenty more to come. So far they've had some local radio play and performed at a few festivals, but I wouldn't be surprised if **Port Isla** get much bigger much faster in **2013**.
