From their press release I get the impression that **Boo, Forever** are really proud that they sound like **Bon Iver**. It's not all that hard to understand, either; the last, eponymous, **Bon Iver** record was one of the best albums to have been made in the last few years, and there's no shame in having high ambitions. There's no denying, either, that **Boo, Forever** do a damn good impersonation. In *Bones* this ‘collective’ of lo-fi folktronicists have written one song, at least, that could well have come straight from the pen (and vocal chords) of Justin Vernon himself.

Sonic doppelgängers aside for a moment, *Bones* feels out of place on this record. It stands apart. The album feels like it was born of inspiration and experimentation, whereas *Bones* feels decidedly “written”; a complete work that exists just as much in the craft and arrangement as in the performance. Conversely, the rest of this **LP** puts me more in mind of the organic sound-sculpture of **The Books** or the improvisation-led experimentation of *Laid*-era **James** than it does **Bon Iver**, despite the music being absolutely riddled in Iver-isms.

It could be said there's *too much* imitation on this record. The otherworldly hollering and firework sound effects on *The Bloodred*, for instance, sounds more like a plagiarism of *Creature Fear* than a homage. But when this record shines is when it doesn't sound like anyone else. **Boo, Forever** do a really good **Bon Iver** impression – so good that I'd still love this record if that's *all* they did – but they're also much better at sounding like **Boo, Forever** and I'd encourage them to work on that aspect of their music more.

As a reviewer it seems like a cheap shot to make easy comparisons, and mentioning **Bon Iver** far more often than the band themselves feels like a bad job done quickly. Even so, there's no getting around it; this record is great, but sits in an obvious and omnipresent shadow. **Boo, Forever** have a great ear for song construction, and the production on this record is the kind that I pray for as a music fan – this is exactly the kind of music that I like! – but I hope the best is yet to come.
