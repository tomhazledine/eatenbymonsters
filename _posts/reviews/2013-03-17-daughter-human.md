After popping up all over the place over the last year or so (most notably with appearances in the *Blog Sound* lists for **2011** _and_ **2012**) **[Daughter](https://soundcloud.com/ohdaughter)** have finally written a track I can get excited about. Their new single *Human* kicks off with more purpose and drive than anything else they've released yet. It's retained the light-touch delicate ephemeral vibe that fellow bloggers have been so endeared by, but in the past that hasn't been enough to excite my interest. In this instance, coupled with their new-found energy, I'm beginning to see what others have been seeing.

*Human* is the current *Single of the Week* on *iTunes*, which I guess is quite a coup for **Daughter**, and ought to bring them a legion of new followers. I'm not ashamed to admit this song has won me over, and I'm now rather keen to hear **Daughter**'s new **LP**Â *If You Leave*.
