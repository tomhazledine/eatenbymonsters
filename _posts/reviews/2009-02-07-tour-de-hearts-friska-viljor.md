When I first hear this record I was immediately struck by the expanse of the sound. Not an epic **U2**-style expanse, but more a breadth of instrumentation reminiscent of early **Arcade Fire** and current favourites **Broken Records**. In short, I was sure there must be at least seven band members. It turns out the band consists of only two guys...

Hailing from Sweden, **Friska Viljor** were formed when two friends, Daniel and Joakim, both broke up with their girlfriends, got drunk, and wrote some songs. So far, so **Bon Iver**, but this isn't the kind of record you'd expect to come from two broken-hearted Swedes; it's phenomenally cheerful.

I must come clean and admit that I usually find "cheerful" music to be a little sickly-sweet and lacking in emotional scope, and yes, this **LP** does occasionally get a little cheesy. Yet thankfully it still manages to retain some bite, and there's certainly some very good songs on display here. On a couple of tracks they dabble with some generic synthesizer action (which sounds hopelessly European) but when they stick to _real_ instruments they make for a highly engaging and satisfying listen.
