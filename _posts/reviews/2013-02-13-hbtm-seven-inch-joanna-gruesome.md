There's a very distinct pleasure I get from seeing music release in what I think is ‘the right way’. **HBTM** Records (*Happy Birthday To Me*) tick all the right boxes with [their origin story](http://hhbtm.com/faq); they began a singles club almost by accident, then moved organically into albums, slowly building up a strong stable of artists. It's a pretty safe bet that I'll be covering more bands from this label in the near future, but at the moment my attention is being held by this scuzzy **7**" from the fantastically-named **Joanna Gruesome**.

I'm often found waxing lyrical about the joys of crisp production and the attention to detail that marks out great recordings from the rest of the pack, but every so often I seek solace in something a little more rough and ready; a little more heartfelt, even. *Do You Really Wanna Know Why Yr Still In Love With Me?* and *Lemonade Girl*, the two tracks that make up this delightfully home-made single, deliver all of that and more. Both tracks on this single are well crafted pop gems dressed up in lo-fi attitude, and both leave you sightly bruised and hungry for more. And if I'm honest, there's not much more you can ask from a single.
