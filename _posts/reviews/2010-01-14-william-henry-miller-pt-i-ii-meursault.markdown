It's not often that I dig out the ol' vinyl player. If fact, being the fresh faced youth I am, the world of vinyl is one of which I have only a cursory knowledge. Anytime I want to enjoy my (admittedly meagre) **7"** collection I have to drag my dad's old [Pioneer PL-112D](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3560/3320377796_6c0cec9d21.jpg) turntable out of the attic...

But it does appear that the **7"** is still alive and well. An old flatmate of mine had quite an impressive collection - all released in the last few years - and most singles seem to get a **7"** release alongside the newer formats. These two singles from Song, by Toad Records are available exclusively as vinyl (not counting digitally, which surely doesn't count these days). The band behind this pair of singles is **Meursault**, already an Eaten by Monsters favourite owing to their fantastic debut **LP**, [_Pissing on Bonfires/Kissing With Tongues_](/pissing-on-bonfireskissing-with-tongues-meursault/).

Now I gather that *William Henry Miller* is something of a live favourite for hardcore **Meusault** fans, but I must admit that when it was  finally released (on last years _Nothing Broke_ **EP**) I wasn't all that taken with it. To be honest, [I wasn't that taken with the whole EP](/nothing-broke-meursault/); I enjoyed it, for sure, but having never seen the band live and getting to know them through their album, the change of direction (from dense electronic soundscapes with a furious energy to a slower, more contemplative acoustic sound) wasn't what I was looking for. In the months following it's release _Nothing Broke_ has certainly grown on me, but in my opinion these two new singles mark a welcome return to the more "produced"\* sound of _Pissing/Kissing_. In fact, the **B**-sides (_The Dirt and the Roots_ and _A Few Kind Words_ respectively) are the same cuts that were used on the album.

And now _William Henry Miller Pt. II_ - a track that sounded decidedly like filler on _Nothing Broke_ - is now the stand out track of both these singles; a feat made doubly impressive when you consider that _A Few Kind Words_ (the _Pt. II_ **B**-side) was one of my favourite tracks on the album, which was in turn one of my [Top 10 Albums of 2008](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/top-10-albums-of-2008/). AndÂ _Pt. I_ has undergone a caterpillar/butterfly rebirth as well! The word on the street is that **Meursault** are on the brink of writing/recording a new album, and if that's true then I really can't wait.

\*Lazy writing, I know...
