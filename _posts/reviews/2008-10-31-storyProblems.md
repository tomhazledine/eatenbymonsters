<a href="http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/storyproblems_cover.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-74" title="storyproblems_cover" src="http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/storyproblems_cover.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="230" /></a>I stumbled upon this album whilst perusing the "<a href="http://elbo.ws/">elbo.ws</a>" blog aggregator.  It's kind of like the <a href="http://hypem.com/">Hype Machine</a>, but not as huge, and a little bit more friendly.

As a result, I know next to nothing about <em>The Glasses</em>, other than what I read about him on his site (he's a solo project, it would appear...)

The music's nice, in a <em><a href="http://www.kweller.net/">Ben Kweller</a></em> kinda way, but sounds just a little to unsure of itself for my tastes.  I'm sure his <em>next</em> album will be well worth a listen, but the delivery of this one lacks the confidence to engage the listener with his songs.  There's some lovely moments, to be sure.  Now this is starting to sound like quite a harsh review, and that's not my intention at all.  I strongly recomend that you give this a listen, especially if you're fond of the 60's pop that seems to be in-vogue all of a sudden (just listen to the Fleet Foxes album to hear what I'm talking about), but it's just not my cup of tea.

If you're intrigued and want to hear Story Problems, then mosey on down to his <a href="http://www.story-problems.com/Home.html">site</a>, where he's "doing a Radiohead" and giving it away for free but leaving an honesty box for anyone who want to do the right thing and pay.
