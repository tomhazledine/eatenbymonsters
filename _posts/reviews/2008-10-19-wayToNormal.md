Heavens, Ben's gotten a little sweary with this one! Don't get me wrong, I'm all for expletives, but I can't help but feel Folds' getting a bit old for this s**t.

Anyway, in short, this album's all substance and no style.  A lot of people bemoaned the lack of the trade mark Folds humour in his previous album <em>Songs for Silverman</em>, and they'll all be pretty pleased with <em>Way to Normal</em>; there's chuckles aplenty.  Sadly the humour comes at a cost: the jokes and ideas come at the expense of scansion and melody.  This album's far too wordy and disjointed to stand up as a truly great album; something Folds has already shown he's capable of.  This one's just a little too contrived, and a little over-produced too.  There's far too much vocal compression on his vocal, and it sucks the life out of the recordings.  This is particularly apparent on the otherwise-pretty-good duet with Regina Spektor, <em>You Don't Know Me</em>.

All things considered, the biggest joke about this release isn't even on the record.  Folds leaked a copy of the CD onto the net, to be lapped up by fans.  It turned out to be the result of a eight-hour session where he and his band mates recorded 6 "fake" songs as a joke at the fans expense.  Priceless!  You can hear the full story <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/22595157/why_i_leaked_it_ben_folds_comes_clean_about_his_fake_and_real_new_album_way_to_normal">here</a>.

Listening to the legit. CD release, however, I can't shake the feeling I've been given the "joke" record by mistake.  While there's nothing particularly exciting about the music on this record (it's all <em>good</em>, just nothing we haven't heard before) it is a truly entertaining listen.  I found myself actually chuckling aloud on a couple of occasions.

The word on the street, though, is that the <em>fake</em> album is actually <em>better</em>! I've not listened to it yet myself, but for those of you who are curious here's a link to a torrent for the <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4327011/Ben_Folds_-_Way_To_Normal_(Leak_-_Fake_Ver)">fake release</a> (and as Folds released it himself, it's a 100% legal download)... I guess that it's got a bit more sparkle and a bit more edge to it, as it's bypassed the "production" prossess that has so mired the official version.
