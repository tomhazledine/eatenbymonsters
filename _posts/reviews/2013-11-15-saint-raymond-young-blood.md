It looks like cooler-than-thou singles-label **[National Anthem](http://www.national-anthem.co.uk/artists/)** have secured themselves another upbeat indie act to add to their small-but-star-studded roster. They’ve already proved themselves to be reliable hipster bellwethers by putting out **7**"s by **Chvrches** and **Haim** “before they were cool” and even their less commercially successful releases have been remarkably good records (both **Atlas Genius**’ *Trojans* and **Sir Sly**’s *Ghost* have never strayed too far from my turntable).

**[Saint Raymond](https://soundcloud.com/saintraymond/)** is their new signing, and his single *Young Blood* is scheduled for release on Jan _5_th. A cursory snoop through his Soundcloud page shows **Saint Raymond** has a good ear for a melody, and *Young Blood* is the best of the bunch. There’s a catchy chorus, staccato guitar lines, gang vocals, and the delivery smacks of the middle-English-geezer accent that’s proven to be so popular throughout **2013**.

Only time will tell if his rise will be as exponential as that of predecessors **Chvrches** and **Haim**, but the fact that he's just signed to **Atlantic** means that those of us waiting for a proper **LP** are unlikely to be disappointed. If the fickle finger of fame has any connection at all to quality music then we’ll no doubt be hearing much more about **Saint Raymond** in **2014**.
