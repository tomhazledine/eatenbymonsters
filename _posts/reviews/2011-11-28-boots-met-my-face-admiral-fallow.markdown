Having finished my review of the [**Moth & The Mirror**](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2011/11/25/honestly-this-world-the-moth-the-mirror/) album I realized that I had yet to review what is, in my eyes, a more important record. One of the contributors to the **Moth & The Mirror** project is Louis Abbot, who's day job is fronting the decidedly excellent [**Admiral Fallow**](http://admiralfallow.bandcamp.com/album/boots-met-my-face), who's debut album _Boots Met My Face_ was re-released earlier this year.

Originally recorded way back in **2009** and released in **2010**, the record managed to completely pass me by until the re-release on [Lo-Five Records](http://lo-five.com/) this March. What gripped me initially was the sound of this record, which sounds like a silly thing to say when talking about music - of course it's the sound we're concerned with! - so perhaps I would do better to say the texture, the colour, the aesthetic grabbed my attention.

As any regular reader of these pages will attest, while I claim to be of catholic tastes there are most definitely some instrumental combinations that are almost guaranteed to pique my interest. Acoustic guitars backed up by sharp, treble-y drums fall slap bang in the middle of that zone, and there's plenty of that on _Boots Met My Face_. Add some non-rock instruments (in this instance it's flutes and clarinets) and, lately, a Scots accent into the mix and you're laughing all the way to the bank - regardless of the quality of the songs themselves.

Thankfully the songs on this record live up to the standards of the aesthetic; Abbot has a good turn of phrase on him, as well as an eye for scansion that's proving surprisingly rare of late. It's not a uniformly good record - here and there one stumbles upon a jarring texture or a melody that's a little too repetitive and dirge-like - but despite it's flaws, this feels like 'a record of note'. A complaint I leveled at Abbot's side-project, **The Moth & The Mirror**, was that their music lacked the little spark of inspiration necessary to make it an _important_ record. As far as mood and texture and aesthetic are concerned there's not much to separate **Admiral Fallow** from **The Moth & The Mirror** (except, perhaps, a braver touch when it comes to electric guitars in the latter), but I can see _Boots Met My Face_ being a record that I still listening to occasionally for a good long while to come.

Despite being nearly two years old now, this album sounds fresh and current to my ears, and the news that **Admiral Fallow** are already hard at work on their follow-up fills me with hope for the musical prospects of **2012**.
