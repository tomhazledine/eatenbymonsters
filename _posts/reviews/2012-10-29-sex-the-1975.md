![Band photo of The 1975 by Rosie Hardy](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/the1975_rose_hardy.jpg)

Another corker of a track from a band I'd never heard of until they landed in my inbox. This is the sort of song I always wanted to be able to write when I was in school. I was never this good, and I'm too old now to get away with this kind of thing, but I can still enjoy the energy and delivery that **The 1975** inject into the whirling dervish of a single that is _Sex_.

The track stands up well enough on its own, but there's something to be gained from watching the video - the singer has given himself the most ridiculous rock-star haircut. Now, I know this doesn't have anything to do with the music, and I'm guessing you don't visit these pages for my Grazia-esque fashion insights, but _is_ pertinent to the music, I assure you. If nothing else, it shows that this guy is committed to being a rock star; to have the nerve to do that to himself proves that the band is front-and-centre in his ambitions. And that's an essential part of this music; utter commitment, manic youthful energy.

Anyway, haircuts aside, this song is fantastic, and an exploration of [their soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/the1975) won't go unrewarded either. The record is released by Vagrant on the 20th November, and is available for [pre-order through iTunes](http://smarturl.it/the1975sexep) (although there's no sign of any physical release yet, which is a shame).
