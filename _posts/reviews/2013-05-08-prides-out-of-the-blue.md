When they were writing *Out of the Blue* there was a lot of debate [within **Prides**](http://thepopcop.co.uk/2013/05/constructing-the-perfect-pop-song-prides-out-of-the-blue/) as to whether or not it sounded too much like *Kids* by **MGMT**. There’s no denying there are definite parallels in tone and structure, but Prides were right to stick to their guns, let comparisons be damned and let the song set its own course.

Lately I’ve been finding this brand of electro-pop to be very easy on the ears indeed. To tell the truth, I’m more than a little confused and troubled by this newfound passion of mine. This music is so far from what I’ve always considered to be ‘proper’ music, and yet I can’t help but find it infectious and addictive.

What does strikes me – even through my love-blind obsession – is that generally these acts are very nearly one-hit-wonders. **MGMT** have two fantastic songs, but nothing else of merit, and the same can be said of **M83** (two blistering singles, and everything else is utter dross). **Chvrches** have so far released nothing but singles: three good ones so far, but how long can they keep that up for? I’ll bet all the money in my pockets against all the money in your pockets that their album will be choked to death with filler.

**Prides**, much like those that came before them, make no bones about their ambitions. Signed to a development deal by island records, they changed their name from **Midnight Lion**, promoted their live guitarist to a full-time band member and songwriter, and began writing in earnest.

Their first outing in their new clothes, *Out of the Blue* was very much crafted to be a hit from the opening riff to the chorus to the breakdown. Only time will tell if they’re successful or not financially, but on an aesthetic level they’ve triumphed on a massive scale. This record is instantly accessible, and infinitely hook-ridden.

Does that accessibility come at a price? Maybe in a week or two, when a ‘proper’ record would be on the verge of spilling a few more of it’s tightly guarded secrets, this single may sound thin and boring; lacking the depth and complexity that rewards repeat listening in exchange for guaranteed instant listener gratification. What we can be sure of, however, is that no matter how fleeting the pleasure, this record sounds simply marvelous for the time being.
