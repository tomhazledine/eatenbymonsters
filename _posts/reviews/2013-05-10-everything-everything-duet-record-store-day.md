Yep, you read it right, **Everything Everything** went ‘all out’ for *Record Store Day 2013* by taking the unprecedented step of scribbling on the cover of their latest **7"** single, *Duet*. Okay, joking aside this maybe isn't the most impressive of the ‘special editions’ that were released for **RSD** this year (or ever), but at least they're making _some_ effort for a good cause.

I've had the latest **Everything Everything** album, *Arc*, for a while now, and may well get around to giving it a proper write-up sometime soon, but I'll tell you right now that it's not _so_ good as to give me a burning desire to tell everyone about it as soon as possible (as happened with recent records from [**Daughter**](http://eatenbymonsters/review/daughter-if-you-leave/) and [**Deptford Goth**](http://eatenbymonsters/review/deptford-goth-life-after-defo/)). What *Arc* does have going for it is a set of killer singles, and Duet is definitely one of those.

Packed full of **Everything Everything**'s signature blend of lyrical playfulness and melodic inventiveness, but this time with an orchestral backing with strong echoes of *Cloud Bursting*-era **Kate Bush** (or *Viva-La-Vida*-era **Coldplay**, if we're being cruel). With the introduction of the band proper, *Duet* builds to the sort of satisfying climax that is so beloved of those in charge of synching music for **BBC** documentaries. What makes this single worth owning, however, is the ‘alternate’ **B**-side version; an edit of the song that uses just the vocals and the string section. Whether this cut of the track is _better_ than the album version, I can't decide, but it's really nice to hear an edit that has the courage to stick with a good idea and not dilute it at all.
