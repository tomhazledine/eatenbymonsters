[**Town Hall**](http://www.facebook.com/TownHallBand), who impressed me recently with their [_Sticky Notes & Paper Scraps_](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/sticky-notes-paper-scraps-town-hall/) **EP**, have a new single out in support of their upcoming album. The track is called _Good Boy_, and will released as a free download on the their [Bandcamp](http://townhall.bandcamp.com/) page soon, but for now you can get your kicks from the music video they've made for the song (another sterling [Mason Jar Music](http://www.masonjarmusic.com/) production).

It's great to see a band that can so consistently keep up such high standards - I often find little videos like the one that alerted me to **Town Hall's** existence, but rarely does my further exploration reveal more stuff of a similar quality, let alone _better_ stuff, as is the case here. The **Town Hall** album, _Roots and Bells_, comes out on the **15**th of this month, and now I'm even more eager to hear it than I already was.
