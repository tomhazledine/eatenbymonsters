Released on the super-duper <a href="http://team-love.com/">Team Love Records</a>, who are down with all the Web 2.0 kids (ie. they give some stuff away for free and are quite friendly - watch this space for a full label profile in the coming week), and licensed here in the UK to <a href="http://www.moshimoshimusic.com/news/"> Moshi Moshi</a> (who positively ooze cool), and the follow-up to 2006's stupendous <em>Bottom of Barrels</em>, "<em>O</em>" should have been a dead cert. for everyone's best-of-'08 lists.  Sadly, having now heard the thing, I'm not so sure; though it could grow on me.

For those of you unfamiliar with the band, Tilly and the Wall are a 3-girls-2-boys outfit who rode out of the depths of Omaha on the back of Conor Oberst (a big favourite in this house).  Their main gimmick is that in place of a drummer they have a tap dancer.  Sadly it would appear they haven't the faith in their convictions, as many of the songs on this record feature real drums.  Which is, quite frankly, a bit of a let down.

The sleeve to this records has been touted as having a swish die-cut oval that showcases some fan-submitted artwork.  This doesn't seem to be in evidence on the copy I have. The cover is pretty dire; monotone and pixelated; reminiscent of a self-release by a rubbish garage-punk band.

That aside, it's not all bad news.  <em>O</em> takes a while to get started, but does eventually deliver some fairly good tunes, though it's a bit of a battle getting to them.  To my ears (speaking as someone who rates their last album quite highly) this is all a bit too childish and, dare I say it, pop.  Nineties pop, to be precise.  <em>Beat Control</em>, in particular, is <em>very</em> dated.  In fact, I'll go as far as to say this whole record is about ten years too late...
