Dickensian scally **Emile Bernard** has released a video for his new single, due out in December. I’m pleased to report that the track itself, *The Way*, is a very impressive three minutes of indie songsmithery. The sound of a slightly distorted bass guitar is one I’ve been enjoying a lot lately, and coupled with the obligatory jangly guitars and assertive drumming it lends *The Way* an urgency and imperative that lifts the track to a level not often reached by the many indie-wannabes that land in my inbox. I’ve spent more time than I ought to lately mucking about with my [Bass Big Muff π](http://www.talkbass.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/1417/title/electro-harmonix-bass-big-muff/cat/15), and this blend of bass, guitar, drums and voice is exactly the sound I’ve been striving towards. So in a way I’m frustrated that **Emile Bernard** has succeeded where I have failed, but it sounds so good that mostly I’m just glad to hear it.

And for any of you thinking “hang on, I thought Émile Bernard was one of the post-impressionists?” one look at his [twitter avatar](https://twitter.com/emilebernarduk) will show you where frontman Paolo came by the inspiration for his band’s _nom de geurre_.
