The [**Young Knives**](http://www.young-knives.com/) are, one would assume, a successful band. They've had a fair bit of national **TV** coverage, a few high-profile licensing synchs, and most tellingly, their first two albums were released by major-indie Transgressive. But appearances can be deceptive and despite the veneer of comfortable mid-league success, the **Young Knives** were not as happy with the arrangement as an outsider might have assumed.

Armed with just a few critically-acclaimed but not-too-highly-charting albums, the band cut their ties with Transgressive to release their third long-player, *Ornaments from the Silver Arcade*, on their own ‘label’, Gadzook in **2011**. Last month band leader Henry Dartnall announced the release of the **Young Knives'** latest **EP**, *Oh Happiness* (and an up-coming **LP** due in the autumn) in [an article for the](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/henry-dartnall/young-knives-diy-album_b_3471787.html) *Huffington Post*, in which he outlined the band's reasons for going totally-independent:

> “A prime example of money spunked away in the name of **Young Knives** include the cover shoot for our sophomore record *Superabundance* which cost **£20,000** (something we found out afterwards), you really should be able to make a couple of records for that much money. So we sacked everyone and bought a mixing desk off eBay for **£1,000**.”

A risky strategy, to be sure, but one that has certainly paid off artistically, at least. Free to experiment, and spurred on by the fast-becoming-ubiquitous Kickstarter backing, the **Young Knives** have crafted an **EP** that easily surpasses all their previous work. *Oh Happiness* is definitely rougher round the edges, production wise, but they were never a particularly slick band, anyway, and what really comes across in this little batch of songs is a band not afraid to take an idea and run with it, and consequences be damned. Great stuff, I'm sure you'll agree.
