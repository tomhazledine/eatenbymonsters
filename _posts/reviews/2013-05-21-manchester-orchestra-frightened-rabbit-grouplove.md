At times I worry this site is become a [**Frightened Rabbit** fan-page](http://eatenbymonsters/?s=frightened+rabbit), as whenever they release anything it tends to drown out other records. But if this blog is anything at all, it's a reflection of what I'm listening to and what I'm enjoying; to hide my fandom under a bushel would be to defeat the point. I _do_ like **Manchester Orchestra** – the lynchpin of this two-track 12" – on his own merit, but probably wouldn't have shelled out for this [Record Store Day special release](http://www.recordstoreday.co.uk/) had it not had the **FR** name on the cover.

The format is simple: two songs, both co-written by **Manchester Orchestra** and another band. Side one, *Make It To Me*, is a collaboration with **Grouplove**, an act previously unknown to me, and side two, **Architect**, is a joint effort with **FR**. As I've said many times before, Scott Hutchinson's songwriting is remarkably consistent, and his influence is clear on this record. Hutchison and **MO** frontman Andy Hull's voices blend well together, both tending towards the ‘strained’ end of the performance spectrum, and the duo's writing styles are so similar it's hard to pick out who contributed what.

For *Make It To Me*, the differing styles of the contributors are easier to identify. Overall it feels more like a normal **Manchester Orchestra** track than *Architect* does, but whereas **MO** and **FR'**s styles are fairly well aligned, the outside influence of **Grouplove** is clear from the start. If you're familiar with **Manchester Orchestra** or **Frightened Rabbit** then the sound of *Architect* would come as no surprise, but *Make It To Me* might well induce a raised eyebrow. For starters it's actually rather _joyful_ – a charge that can rarely be raised against **MO** or **FR** – and it's jaunty breakdown owes more to the two-step shenanigans of the brostep scene than any of the styles normally featured on these pages. The less said about the ‘spoken word’ section the better, but the bright and effervescent synths definitely add a certain charm and sparkle, and the catchy chorus – if only brief – is as good as anything churned out by the pop-rock craftsmen of the early noughties.
