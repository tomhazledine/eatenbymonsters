In May last year, **Ian M**c**Culloch** — late of **Echo And The Bunnymen** — had some fun mucking about with a string quartet at London’s premier venue for ‘mature’ rock musicians, Union Chapel. That concert was evidently recorded for posterity and is now seeing itself  released as a live album. To advertise the fact, and to show a little love for independent record shops, **M**c**Culloch** has put out a nifty little **7"** under the Record Store Day banner, containing two songs from that concert.

The **B**-side is the wearisome *Pro Patria Mori*; and never a more trite and clunky effort at songwriting will you ever come across. To hear **M**c**Culloch’**s ageing, gravelly voice strain through the oh-so-sophisticated refrain of “dulce decorum” is to look the sad fate of all over-the-hill-rockers-trying-to-be-relevant straight in the eyes. To hear this and not be sickened requires a stronger constitution than mine.

On the **A**-side, conversely, things are very different indeed. And not because of any difference in delivery or arrangement, either; the strings are as predictable as ever, and **M**c**Culloch** hasn’t changed his delivery at all. No, the crucial factor that marks the **A**-side as ‘worth listening to’ is quite simply the quality of the song. *The Killing Moon* is an all-time classic, and no matter how much dad-rock you inject into the guitar sound, there’s no way on earth the opening riff can be anything less than one of the most exciting intros ever. Anyone who thinks **Arcade Fire** just plucked their sound from the ether would do well to go back to the original recording of this track. **M**c**Culloch** can [wear all the cheesy shades he likes](http://echoesanddust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/McCulloch-e1365264763995.jpg), but he’ll always be tied to the redeeming legacy of *The Killing Moon*.
