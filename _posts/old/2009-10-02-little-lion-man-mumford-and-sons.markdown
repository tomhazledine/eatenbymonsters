![MumfordAndSons_LittleLionMan](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/mumfordandsons_littlelionman.jpg)This band has been scooting round the periphery of my musical awareness for quite a while now.  With good reviews from all sorts of blogs that I respect I should really have made an effort to get into them sooner.  Alas, it actually took a chance encounter at Radio One to alert me to the fact that this band are actually very good.  Radio One, of all places! Christ alive, I never thought I'd see the day.  Anyway, [Mumford and Sons](http://www.mumfordandsons.com/) had recorded on of R1's [Live Lounge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/livelounge/) sessions, and the track that hooked me in was _Little Lion Man_ - despite the fact that a substantial part of the chorus had been muted due to excess profanity.

The day after this accidental R1 experience I listened to a session/interview that the band had recorded for [The Waiting Room](http://www.twrhq.com/) online radio show.  Again, it was excellent, and again it was _Little Lion Man_ that stood out.  It turns out that I actually already had the band's  EP _Love Your Ground_ - featuring _Little Lion Man_ - in my iTunes library, but hadn't taken the time to listen to it.  A shocking oversight, I'm sure you'll agree.

So, Mumford and Sons first full-length, [_Sigh No More_](http://www.roughtrade.com/site/shop_detail.lasso?search_type=sku&sku=318226), comes out on the 5th - when I will most certainly buying it.

(amendment: uh oh, looks like I'm getting some "copyright violation" action, so there'll be no mp3s for a bit... if you're desperate to hear Mumford and Sons I highly recommend checking out the session they did for The Waiting Room - see link above)
