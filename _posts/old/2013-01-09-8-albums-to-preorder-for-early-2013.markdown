I've been trawling through all the lists of imminent record releases, and here's the pick of the litter. If your tastes are anything like mine, then you'd do well to put these dates in your diary.

## Everything Everything - _Arc_


_Released on 14-01-13._ Sweeping the Nation summed up EE rather succinctly when they said they "have more ideas then they really know what to do with and more time than they think to get them all in."


## Villagers - _Awayland_


_Released on 15-01-13._ On 2010's Becoming a Jackal it felt like Conor O'Brien was picking up where Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst had left off. That's no bad thing in my book, so it'll be interesting to see if that trend continues.


## Pictish Trail - _Secret Soundz Vol. 2_


_Released on 21-01._ Vol. 1 is a firm favourite, so be sure not to miss this new installment of the Pictish Trail's madcap adventures.


## Eels - _Wonderful, Glorious_


_Released on_ _05-02._ You never know quite what you're going to get with a new Eels album. All you can tell for sure is that it will be well worth a listen.


## Frightened Rabbit - _Pedestrian Verse_


_Released on 05-02_. My love for all things FR is well documented, so it goes without saying this is the record I'll be most looking forward to in 2013.


## Foals - _Holy Fire_


_Released on 11-02._ I've yet to really fall in love with Foals, but both their past records have had elements that really excited me. Perhaps this is the year they tie it all together?


## Shout Out Louds - _Optica_


_Released on 26-02_. SOL caused a stir before Christmas with their gimmicky record made out of ice, but will the actual LP be of any worth? Based on past performances, it probably will be.


## Deptford Goth - _After Defo_


_Released on 18-03_. This has only recently turned up on my radar and it strays a little from my usual area of experience, but if the single Union is anything to go by, this record is going to be special.

No date for these ones yet, but we can count on LPs from all these chaps in 2013 as well: Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The National, eagleowl, Arcade Fire, Laura Marling, Editors.

Finally, I've yet to hear anything concrete about a new Withered Hand LP, but we can but hopeâ€¦
