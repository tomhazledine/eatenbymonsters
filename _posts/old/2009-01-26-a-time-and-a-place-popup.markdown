![popupalbumcover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/popupalbumcover.jpg)This album came out in October and completely passed me by.  However _A Time and a Place_ is now getting a US release on [Team Love Records ](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/11/13/team-love-records-a-profile/)this coming April, and was brought to my attention via the [Team Love Library](http://library.team-love.com/).  Apparently they're so excited about securing its state-side release that they've put it up for free download for the next month.

I get the impression that the record was a long time coming, as the first singles were released all the way back in '06, but then debuts can always be a labour of love.  [Popup](http://www.myspace.com/popuptheband) aren't quite as impressive as some of the other Scottish bands I've been getting excited about lately, but they are still very good.  The production is sharp and spacious, but with a tendency to err on the side of "jangly indie" when a little more effort could have made it a little more esoteric.  It puts me in mind of a scotch Two Gallants - thought there's a few more layers to this record.

Where they really shine, however, is in the songwriting.  Thankfully eschewing traditional boy-girl "oh I miss you so much" drivel in favour of more unusual ideas (see album opener Love Triangle), the lyrics are never less than good and occasionally brilliant.  It may sound like faint praise to say they're merely "good", but in the current musical environment it's enough to put them head and shoulders above most of the competition.
