_[Not everyone loves Christmas songs but I, for one, can't get enough of them.  Every year it seems we get the same old perennial hits, and I guess that's part of the charm - Christmas is a time for comforting familiarity after all - but most of these aren't as fulfilling as one might hope, musically speaking.  Never fear, however, as this Yuletide help is at hand, in the form of Eaten by Monsters' selection of the best alternative Christmas songs out there.]_

[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/masterslashslave.jpg?w=225)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/masterslashslave.jpg)A lot of my favourite Christmas tracks of recent years have come from the XO Publicity compilation records.  Volume IV is out now, and [can be downloaded for free](http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays4.html), along with it's predecessors, [here](http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays.html).  Not all of them the tracks included are of equal quality, and some are just outright bad, but when they're good they're very, very good.  Expect a few more tracks from those records as we get nearer to Christmas itself, but before that treat yourselves to this sterling effort courtesy of [Master Slash Slave](http://www.myspace.com/master1slave).  The band, which appears to be mostly the work of one man, Matt Jones, who has since disbanded the band, gotten married, and started a new project with his new wife, called [Jonesin'](http://www.myspace.com/jajonesin) (the new band's called that, not the wife).  Anyway, the sentiments in this, the MSS Christmas effort, are ones I can empathize with totally (I'm looking at you, former band mates!).
