[![](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-blog-sound-2012.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-blog-sound-2012.jpg)With the new year fast approaching, those amongst you who are regular readers of music blogs will be well aware that we're on the cusp of list season; that time when every one and his dog compile 'best of the year just gone' and 'ones to watch for the year upcoming' lists.  Part of me feels somewhat silly for getting involved in the list mania that sweeps the blogosphere as January looms on the horizon, but there other parts of me that just love it.

This is partly for purely pragmatic reasons; lists are a great way to generate traffic, and my hits-per-day always grow considerably when I post my end-of-year lists.  The two I normally write - _Top 10 Albums of the Year_ and _Top 10 Songs of the Year_ - are usually my most popular posts of the year, and it's always nice to see my circulation expand.  I also must confess that I really enjoy compiling these lists; staying up late making mix tapes was such a large part of my childhood that I can't help getting somewhat obsessive when it comes to making these digital equivalents.

This year there's something extra for me to get excited about: I shall be running an extra list! (huzzah!) Mid-January usually finds me picking apart the BBC's Sound of... Poll, but this year I'll be supporting an alternative to the Sound of 2012 list.  The Beeb's poll has been growing ever more irrelevant in recent years, and the appalling nature of the Sound of 2011 results seemed to be the straw that broke the camel's back for many in the music blogosphere.  Some of those spurred into action were Andy VonPip, from [the Von Pip Musical Express](http://vonpipmusicalexpress.wordpress.com/), Robin from [Breaking More Waves](http://www.breakingmorewaves.blogspot.com/), and Simon from [Sweeping The Nation](http://sweepingthenation.blogspot.com/):


<blockquote>It was forensically dissected and we expressed both pleasure and horror at some of the artists long listed – but the question that kept coming back was this - _did they really reflect the zeitgeist?_  I mean seriously, is Jessie J the sound of anything other than a badger going through a mincer.</blockquote>






Rather than just sitting around and doing nothing, however, the enterprising trio decided to set up an alternative poll, and proceeded to conduct (it their words, I might add) "a poll of the UK’s best music blogs" to ask the bloggers down at the musical coalface which acts they thought would break in 2012.  I dutifully gave them my picks (it's worth repeating here that they only asked "the UK's _best_ music blogs") and having received a list of five picks from all the _best_ blogs (did I mention that they only asked the 'best'?) they've compiled a long-list to coincide with the Beeb's own ([released today here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16003723)), and here it is - the blogosphere's picks for 2012:


**Houdini Dax**




**Lianne De Haves**




**Theme Park**




**French Wives**




**The Good Natured**




**Alt J**




**The Jezabels**




**Lucy Rose**




**Bastille**




**Washington**




**Friends**




**Meursault**




**Daughter**




**Beth Jeans Houghton**




**Outfit**


There's a couple of names on the list that are new to me, and only one of them has been featured on these pages before (Meursault, for those of you who hadn't guessed) so expect the critical eye of EbM to be focusing on some of these acts in the coming weeks, and once I've had time to chew over the Beeb's long list I'll most likely make my thoughts known here too.
