[![nightjarcover](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/nightjarcover.jpg?w=300)](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/nightjarcover.jpg)Yet another bl**dy scotch indie/folk/whatever band! There must be something in the water up there, as this is the latest in what's becoming a long list of great albums to emerge from that neck o' the woods...

[Nightjar](http://www.myspace.com/nightjarnightjar) set themselves apart from the rest of the pack by presenting a much more stripped-back, rootsy sound.  You could almost be forgiven for thinking it's of Appalachian origin, such is the strong bluegrass flavour that tints most of the songs.

_The Moth Trap_ has apparently been kicking around for quite a while, but has just recieved an offical release on [Song, by Toad Records](http://songbytoadrecords.com/) (you can get your mits on your own copy [here](http://songbytoadrecords.com/2008/11/nightjar-the-moth-trap/)).  As an interesting aside; it features some guest guitar playing from Kris Drever, who's current band was the subject of my [very first CD review](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/10/18/drever-mccusker-woomble-before-the-ruin/) for these hallowed pages...
