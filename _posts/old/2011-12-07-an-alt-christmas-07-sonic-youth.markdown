_[Not everyone loves Christmas songs but I, for one, can't get enough of them.  Every year it seems we get the same old perennial hits, and I guess that's part of the charm - Christmas is a time for comforting familiarity after all - but most of these aren't as fulfilling as one might hope, musically speaking.  Never fear, however, as this Yuletide help is at hand, in the form of Eaten by Monsters' selection of the best alternative Christmas songs out there.]_

Following on from yesterday's move away from the saccharine sweet, schmaltzy nature of most Christmas songs, today's choice drags us down even further.  As with all Sonic Youth's output, it takes a not-inconsiderable effort just to sit through the bally thing but is ultimately well worth it.
