_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

My enjoyment of [Sufjan Stevens](http://music.sufjan.com/)' music is directly proportional to the amount of time and effort I put into listening to it.  The shifts and dynamics of his work are so subtle that it really doesn't work well as background music; it needs your full attention to prevent it sounding boring.  _Illinois_ is a favourite album of mine because I took the time to get to know it, but Sufjan's output is so prodigious that I simply haven't the time nor the inclination to give it all such attention.  Every now and then, however, one of his songs comes to my attention more or less by accident, and I find myself - predictably - growing to like it; thus was the case with the two Christmas songs below.
