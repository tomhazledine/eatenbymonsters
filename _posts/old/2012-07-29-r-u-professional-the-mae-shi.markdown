A bit of a blast from the past, this one.  I saw the latest Batman film the other day and it was, after all the hype, a film [about a man who dresses up as a bat](http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/arts-entertainment/batman-film-actually-about-batman-2012072034995), but nonetheless very good for all that.  It also reminded me that I'd not listened to this gem from [The Mae Shi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mae_Shi) in ages. Written, recorded, and released in the twenty-four hours after the audio from Christian Bale's well-publicized wig-out was made available, _R U Professional_ is half piss-take, half tribute.  It certainly sounds like it was written in a rush, but maybe that's half the fun of it - and 'fun' is the operative word here.  This song's not big, not clever, and in all honesty not particularly good, but it is fun.  It could be argued that I spend too much time being very serious about the music I listen to, so it's nice to throw caution to the wind from time to time and simply bask in the unadulterated joy of something really, really silly.

The band seem to have fizzled out since 2009, but this is a sample of what they did when they weren't being meme-friendly satirists:

And, of course, for those of you who haven't heard it (a.k.a. for those of you who didn't have the internet in '09) here's Mr Bale's little tantrum. Be warned, strong language ahead...

(and just in case you were inclined to sympathize with Mr Bale in a oh-he's-in-the-creative-zone-making-art kind of way, remember that this was on the set of the most recent Terminator; the one with, you know, all the robots.)
