What links James, U2, Talking Heads, Devo and Coldplay?  Bugger all, you might be forgiven for thinking, but you'd be wrong.  Their best albums were all produced by the same man: [Brian Eno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno_discography).

This is something of a first for the Bearfaced Podcast; practically a documentary, this episode features not only a stellar line-up of songs, but also extracts from all sorts of interviews and TV shows.  The aim of this 'cast is to serve as an introduction to the more populist side of Eno's work; possibly the most influential producer of all time, who's had a huge influence on a veritable cornucopia of genres and styles.

He's got a new record out this autumn, which you can find all about [on his site](http://brian-eno.net/), but for now sate your appetites with this sample of his biggest hits, inter-spliced with some enlightening footage stolen from all sorts of places.

As usual, you can get the Bearfaced Podcast through iTunes, download the mp3 directly from the [Bearfaced website](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#podcasts/latest/), or just by using the embedded player below:
