![frightenedrabbit_live](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/frightenedrabbit_live.jpg?w=300)I'm still deeply enamoured of Frightened Rabbit's LP _[Midnight Organ Fight](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/the-midnight-organ-fight-frightened-rabbit/)_, but the production is starting to sound just a little cheesy.  Thankfully the songs (and their dirty, dirty lyrics) are good enough to cut through the polish and still pack a pretty hefty punch.

If you fancy seeing FR "live" then I'd recommend having a goosey at the four songs they played on Gaelic music show [_Rapal_](http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/alba/radio/rapal/).  The show's almost exclusively in Gaelic with English subtitles, but it's worth persevering to witness the songs _sans_ high production values.  It's not a jaw-droppingly amazing performance, but if you're a fan of the band and (like me) haven't seen them live yet, then it certainly makes for interesting viewing.  You can view the show on the iPlayer [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00gmlm2/Rapal_Rapal_Episode_1/), and I guess it'll be available for the next six days or so.
