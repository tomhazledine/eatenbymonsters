[![Podcast 6B](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/20090213_podcast6b1.jpg?w=300)Here it is](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#tagged/?id=84), as promised: Part "B" of Bearfaced Podcast 06.  Last week, in [Part "A"](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#tagged/?id=83), I was talking about the up-coming releases that have piqued our interest here at Bearfaced Towers, and this week I had the honour to be joined in the studio by [Tom Stephens and the Retreat](http://www.myspace.com/tomstephensandtheretreat).

The whole band came in and recorded a couple of "live" tracks for us, and the next day Tom Stephens (lead vocals and guitar) and Tom Cornish (lead guitar and backing vocals) came in for an interview, where they deigned to play us an acoustic version of their new song _Olivia_.  The interview stayed surprisingly on-topic (especially given Bearfaced interviews' past form) and as a result you can hear the guys regaling us with tales about being an independent band out-and-about on the mean streets of London, as well as enlightening us with regard to their songwriting process.  All lovely stuff, I'm sure you'll agree.

The band has undergone a bit of a line-up change since I [reviewed their EP last year](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/ep-tom-stephens-and-the-retreat/), and their "sound" has also evolved quite a bit too.  As always you can find the Bearfaced Podcast in iTunes, but if you'd rather just download the individual episode then you can do that from the Bearfaced Website [here](http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#tagged/?id=84).
