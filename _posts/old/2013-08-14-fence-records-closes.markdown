It was with a cry of despair that I saw the terrible subject line in my inbox this morning: “Farewell To Fence‏”. With so many of my most valued cultural sources stumbling to a halt in this modern age – **Word** magazine, **Google Reader**, practically every record shop I've ever been to – it came as little surprise to learn that one of my all-time favourite record labels was set to shut up shop. Living, as I do, at the other end of the country, the Fife-based ‘collective’ that was **Fence Records** always seemed like a shining hub of magical creativity and invention. It inspired me to set up not one but _two_ independent labels of my own, and more importantly provided me with some of the best music of the last decade.

![fence_logo](http://eatenbymonsters/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fence_logo-620x177.jpg)Mercifully all is not as bad I first feared; the label hasn't gone bust, all the current artists are still making music, it's just that the situation has changed. Since founder **Kenny Anderson** – better known to **EBM** readers as **King Creosote** – left **Fence** to focus on his own music-making efforts, the label has been run by **Johnny Lynch** – better know to **EBM** readers as **The Pictish Trail**. Johnny has lately been based in the Hebridean island of **Eigg**, and in his own words:


<blockquote>“All of a sudden there wasn’t much Fife in **Fence**, or much **Fence** in Fife.”</blockquote>


So they're having a ‘re-brand’ (as Johnny _doesn't_ want to call it), and the fantastic records will continue to flow (we hope). The new venture has yet to be named, and will apparently be christened at the last-ever **Fence** **Records** showcase at the [**Green Man Festival**](https://www.facebook.com/events/159959330862315/) on Friday. So the news is not as bleak as it at first seemed, but the passing of a musical icon should still be marked with some well-earned solemnity.
