![found](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/found.jpg?w=300)A few years ago, in the halcyon days of my youth, I found myself in a mind-numbingly menial summer job that involved excessive exposure to Radio One all day everyday.  This was, of course, a black period in my life, but the incessant nagging and appalling playlist repetition did serve one purpose.  It was in this manner that I first heard about the [SXSW (South by South West) Festival](http://sxsw.com/music).

Now it appears that SXSW can be the making or breaking of many a new band, and is as such considered "quite a big deal".  Alas, SXSW is held in Austin, Texas (allegedly the last bastion of taste, decency and free thinking in that cultural wasteland that is the Deep South) and therefore a bit of a bugger to get to if you're from the UK.

So, in order to raise the funds for their airfare, Scottish indie scenesters [Found](http://foundtheband.com/) have released the download-only LP [_Snarebrained_](http://foundtheband.com/news/snarebrained/).  I know [two "charity" posts in as many weeks](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2009/01/24/dark-was-the-night-a-red-hot-compilation/) is a little gauche of me, and this record consists mostly of remixes and collaborations, which is a format that can be rather hit or miss, but it is still rather good despite itself.  And it's all for a good cause, as if that made any difference.

You can buy and stream _Snarebrained_ from their website (see link above) but to whet your appetite here's an old one of theirs:
