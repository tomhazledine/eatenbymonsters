_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

The [Casiotone For The Painfully Alone](http://www.cftpa.org/home.htm) brand has been retired for over a year now, but that's no reason not to enjoy this festive little ditty.  A reason not to enjoy it would be the stark bleakness of the lyrics; I'm a big believer in the 'cheer' part of Christmas, but nevertheless there's still a few less-than-cheerful numbers amongst my Christmas playlist, this being one of the more obvious examples.
