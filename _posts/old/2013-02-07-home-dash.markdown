So you like all the indie electro-pop I've been posting lately? Well that's lucky, because all the evidence suggests we're living in a golden age of breezy, cheerful, synth/guitar goodness. The latest taster comes courtesy of **[dash](https://soundcloud.com/dashtunes)**, a young five-piece from North Carolina. Well, I've no proof that they are young, but their music exudes a certain youthful energy that's immensely endearing.

**dash** seem to be a band in their nascent stages. Their web presence is [rather sparse](http://www.facebook.com/dashtunes), but hints at more things on the horizon. Until they emerge all we've got to go on is a couple of singles, of which ** home** is the most recent. The track bombs along with a furious energy, and while it definitely sounds like a band still finding it's feet, the song more than holds its own against the more seasoned faces in the genre. In fact, there's a polish and self-assured urgency to **dash**'s music that, if anything, sets them above their competition.
