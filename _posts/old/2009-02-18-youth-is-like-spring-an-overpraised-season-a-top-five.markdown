Young people with talent; don't you just hate them? This week's Wednesday Top Five is in honour of those snot-nosed brats who managed to make meaningful contributions to the word before leaving their teens.  Damn their eyes.  According to neuroscientist Daniel Levitin it takes ten thousand hours work to make someone a "master" of any particular skill, so this is essentially a list of kids who should really have got out more...

5. **_Jenny Lewis_, from Rilo Kiley**.  Not a true musical prodigy, but she was kicking up a fuss as a child actress by the time she was ten.

4. _**Buddy Holly**_. The ultimate live-fast-die-young idol.  He wrote awesome songs, got shafted by his manager, played with Elvis, and died in an plane crash; all at the tender age of twenty two.

3. _**Laura Marling**_.  Last year's darling of the London indie set, Marling wrote all the songs on her debut Alas, I Cannot Swim before she was eighteen.

2. _**Conor Oberst**_**, from Bright Eyes**. This precocious scamp has been writing and recording music since he was ten.  His first EP, _Water_ was the inaugural release for Saddle Creek Records (then called Lumberjack Records), and was recorded when he was just thirteen.  Admittedly most of his early stuff was absolute rubbish, but there were the odd sparks of genius.

1. _**Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart**_.  This cheeky bugger was composing by the age of five, allegedly wrote his first fugue aged six, and was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg aged only seventeen, where he performed before the Austrian royal family.  For the record, his full name is _Johann Chrysostom Wolfgang Theophilus Mozart_ (Amadeus is Latin for Theiophilus, and not actually his name at all, even though his signed all his manuscripts _Wolfgang Amadeus_)
