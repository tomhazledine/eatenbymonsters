![Patience](http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/bored.jpg?w=270)As some of you have noticed, I've not been around much over the past month.  But there's good news for all of you who've been left on tenterhooks waiting for your not-quite-daily dose of Eaten by Monsters goodness; I'm back.  First of all I'd like to offer my sincerest apologies to all the bands who've gotten in touch with me over the past month or so; quite a few of them were trying to spread the word about events that have now been and gone.  A quick perusal of my inbox, however, shows me that many of the releases are still current and worth reviewing, so there'll be some real music-based activity here just as soon as I can absorb some of it properly.

Of the items in my inbox, it's about a half-and-half split between soulless press releases and more personal appeals for attention.  I can't speak for any other bloggers, and certainly not for any real journalists, but I despise press releases with a passion.  Don't get me wrong, I make an effort to listen to all the stuff I'm sent regardless of how it's presented, but a bad press release can have a considerable effect of my first impressions of the music.  It's shallow of me, I'll admit, but it's the truth.  The submissions that _do_ grab my attention are always the more personal ones.

Now by "personal" I don't merely mean that they're addressed to me; since the advent of automated mailing list software this has ceased to mean anything.  Nor do I expect to recieve a 100% unique email; If you're promoting your band properly then you'll be emailing loads of different people and can't realistically be expected to attend to every single blog on an individual basis.  What I look for in a submission is simply good copy.  I want to read something that's been writen by a human being, not a PR machine.  For the love of god you should avoid cliché like the plague [sic].  A little hyperbole is to be expected - these bands are selling themselves, after all - but meaningless phrases and trite comparisons instantly cheapen the experiece for a reviewer.

In my experience, honesty and enthusiasm always shine through in submissions, no matter how "unprofessional" they may appear.  I'm not exactly a huge outfit myself (insert scathing waistline joke here), and I'm not looking to write about huge arena-filling bands.  Anyway, this post seems to have drifted somewhat off-topic so I'll cut the rant short.  I'm back, and there'll be some proper new music stuff on these pages soon.  Your patience is very much appreciated...
