It's beginning to look like **2013** might be a good year for **Kings of Convenience** to make a comeback. I doubt they will, as they've been off the scene for a long time now, but most of the really good releases so far this year have a shade of the **Quiet Is The New Loud** philosophy that **KOC** honed into such a fine art in the middle of the last decade. None have been quite as definitively hushed and muted as **KOC**, but there's an unmistakable mood in the air that says this is a year for thoughtful, introspective music.

With a name like **Oh So Quiet**, this Guildford duo are nailing their colours to the mast from the get-go, but their eponymous **EP** has more depth and bombast to it than the name suggests. Things start of predictably enough, with caressed nylon-stringed guitar action and breathy, hushed vocals, but it's not too long before a full band rhythm section makes an appearance and we realize that we're not just dealing with a pair of bedroom musicians. If **Oh So Quiet** sound gentle and understated, it's very much a conscious choice on their part and not a limit that's been imposed on them by their surroundings. When they want to (for want of a better expression) ‘rock out’ they are fully capable of doing so.

The ease with which this band can switch from subtle acoustics to wailing indie-pop electric guitar lines and then back again is impressive, and lifts this **EP** above the morass of singer/songwriter types who attempt something similar. In the cadences and delivery of the female voice I'm reminded very much of [**Emily And The Woods**](http://eatenbymonsters/music/eye-to-eye-emily-and-the-woods/), but where Emily fell down was when extra elements were tacked onto what was very much a solo show. With **Oh So Quiet** it's clear that the band that fleshes out this record is as much a vital part of the music as the singer/songwriters at the core of it.
