_[Not everyone loves Christmas songs but I, for one, can't get enough of them.  Every year it seems we get the same old perennial hits, and I guess that's part of the charm - Christmas is a time for comforting familiarity after all - but most of these aren't as fulfilling as one might hope, musically speaking.  Never fear, however, as this Yuletide help is at hand, in the form of Eaten by Monsters' selection of the best alternative Christmas songs out there.]_

It was the fantastic CD packaging that first drew me in to _Rest Now, Weary Head! You Will Get Well Soon_, an album by German singer-songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Konstantin Gropper, who trades under the _nom de plume_ [Get Well Soon](http://www.youwillgetwellsoon.com/).  Thankfully the music was of such a high quality that this album gets listened to on a semi-regular basis at EbM Towers.  This festive-themed track from that record serves nicely as an overview of Gropper's music generally, and if you want more he's just released a free live EP as a pre-tour X-mas present, which can be found [on his website](http://www.youwillgetwellsoon.com/konzerthaus/epeu.htm).
