When a video of a band covering Jimmy Eat World's _[The Middle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR3oa2r5qtE&feature=player_embedded)_ landed in my inbox a month or so ago, the first thing that struck me was that it was really, really slick.  It purported to be a 'live' session, but the production values for both the sound and the visuals were far above what one normally expects from a hitherto unknown band (Brooklyn-based indie-folk outfit [Town Hall ](http://www.facebook.com/TownHallBand)may have released their debut, _Tour EP_, at least a year ago, but I'd certainly never heard of them before).  The impressive video - and it's equally impressive collection of microphones and instruments - makes more sense upon learning that the _Tour EP_ made its way into the hands of the prodigiously talented (or at the very least prodigiously dedicated) people at [Mason Jar Music](http://www.masonjarmusic.com/).

This self-styled collective of creative types specialize in both video work and sound production, with instrumental arrangement being their speciality.  They've teamed up with Town Hall to re-record and re-release their EP, which is now called _[Sticky Notes & Paper Scraps](http://townhall.bandcamp.com/)_ and boasts the work of a deft and accomplished sonic touch.  I'm often disparaging of bands using covers to help break themselves into the mainstream, but perhaps I ought to re-evaluate my stance; in this instance the cover served as an effective gateway drug into a band with a genuinely beautiful aesthetic and some cracking songs to match it.
