Today's aural treat marks a return to more organic sound. **[eliza and the bear](elizaandthebear.com)**'s music doesn't have the synthetic elements that have dominated the pages of this blog lately, and it proves that you don't need a drum machine and a Micro Korg to be upbeat and energetic. While synth pads and 808 snare hits have been dominating my playlists of late, this is the kind of music that I really hanker for.

There's acoustic guitars and trebly, uncompressed kick stomps aplenty on this release, and the band's aesthetic borders on the tweed-y (and yes, I think at least one of them may have a beard), but there's none of the faux-folk pretensions that mire so many of **eliza and the bear**'s contemporaries.



There's an obvious ambition at work here - you don't write songs with this much scope for anthemic barnstorming and then hide yourself away in your bedroom - but the crucial element is that, beneath all the bravado and rousing harmonies, both **The Southern Wild** and **Upon The North** are fantastic songs, pure and simple.
