Who'd've thought there'd be that many right-thinking voters across the pond.  Not I, for sure... for the <a href="http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2008/11/04/a-thousand-words-styrofoam/">second time this week</a> I'm glad to have been proven wrong.  And now it's Bonfire Night; hurrah!  And thus, this week's Top Five is in honour of Obama's 2008 victory and Guido Fawkes' 1605 defeat.

Feast your eyes on the official* Top Five Songs About Revolution, Dissent, and the Dawning of a New World Order.

It's kinda predictable that most of the songs on this list'll be punk tunes, and sadly all the best punk songs are the ones that everyone knows best.  Apparently familiarity breeds contempt, and most people are already pretty darn familiar with the all the songs on my first draft of this list, and that's really not what music blogging's about.  <em>London's Calling</em>, <em>Anarchy in the UK</em>, and <em>Babylon's Burning</em> are great songs, but if you wanted that kind of list you'd be reading a "heritage" magazine (will <em>Q</em>, <em>Mojo</em>, <em>Word</em> and <em>Uncut</em> please stand up) so in the interests of interest I've gone for a slightly more "obscure" top 5.  (and this is where any genuine punk fans chip in and tell me off for being too stayed and middle class...)

5: <strong><em>When the President Talks to God</em> by Bright Eyes</strong>. I guess the US election result means we've only got a month or so until we can't play this one anymore, so enjoy it while it's still relevant.

4: <strong><em><span class="mw-redirect">Haillie Sellasse</span>, Up Your Ass</em> by Propagandhi</strong>.  Some downright silly and impotent punk for your listening pleasure.  So very angry, and so very cute.

3: <strong><em>The Beat That My Heart Skipped</em> by Dan Le Sac Vs Scroobius Pip</strong>. Based around a reasonably personal encounter, but still all about revolution; albeit a cultural one.  Just funny enough to avoid being pompus.

2: <strong><em>Unity</em> by Operation Ivy</strong>. Seminal '90s punk group shouting about how war is, like, bad, man.

1: <strong><em>Bhindi Bhagee</em> by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros</strong>. Now this is a song about a new world order; multiculturalism at its best.  And plus, there was no way Strummer wasn't going to make this list in some form or another. <em>And </em>there's an electric drill solo; what more could anyone want from a band?
