<a href="http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/teslacoil.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-149" title="tesla coil" src="http://eatenbymonsters.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/teslacoil.jpg?w=300" alt="tesla coil" width="300" height="266" /></a>I like to think of myself as a well-rounded, mature music listener who never discriminates based on genre alone, but alas, everyone has their own biases.  I for one, if I'm honest, have a definite acoustic* lilt to my tastes, and I am often caught giving second chances to records on account of their instrumental makeup.  For example, I'll spend more time trying to "absorb" music by a band that includes a cello and an accordion than I really ought to, even if they're obviously rubbish, whereas I'm likely to dismiss a D'n'B band without giving them the time and attention they could potentially deserve.  But hey, we're all human, so I don't let it bother me.  In fact, I guess you could say I embrace it.

And so to the point: as a result of our personal tastes, if we like something that could be seen as being a bit out of our musical comfort zones it's because it's genuinely knocked our socks off.  Q.E.D., this week's Top Five "Electronic" Songs should be bl**dy awesome.  And before you ask, there's not a single act on this list from Sheffield.

5. <strong><em>Panic Racer 500</em> by YMCK</strong>.  Okay, I may have shot myself in the foot already, as this track's not actually awesome, but it made the list on account of its comedy value.  It's some crazy 8-bit Japanese faux-arcade-game-soundtrack. Enjoy...

4. <strong><em>Worked Up So Sexual</em> by The Faint</strong>.  These guys describe their sound as "like the '80s, but f*cked-up", which is a pretty reasonable approximation.  The song itself is properly super, and if you want proof of this then check out Elliot Dawson's acoustic (see, I love that stuff!) cover that can be found on the first <a href="http://www.bearfacedrecords.com/#tagged/?id=24">Bearfaced Podcast</a>.

3. <strong><em>Such Great Heights</em> by The Postal Service</strong>. Ben Gibbard's electro side-project, which bizarrely seems to be more successful, in the UK at least, than his real band (Death Cab, for all the philistines out there...). This is one of those albums that sound great when you first hear them, but sadly don't hold up at all well under the scrutiny of repeated listening.  This particular song, however, has become a bit of a poster-boy for any indie kids who want to show that they're "branching out"... Again, the quality of the song is demonstrated by the high number of good quality covers by everyone from Iron &amp; Wine to Ben Folds.

2. <strong><em>Decipher Reflections</em> by Play Radio Play!</strong>. This wunderkind shot to fame back when everyone was convinced that you could have a career just by being on myspace.  As far as I'm aware, he got well over 2 million "friends" without any press at all, purely by word of mouth; not bad for a "true-love-waits" 16yr old.  Last time I bothered to check his 'space he'd been snapped up by a label and was about to release an album.  That was well over a year ago, and I haven't heard anything else since.  Pity, as he was actually rather good.

1. <strong><em>Are "Friends" Electric?</em> by Gary Numan</strong>. Ever caught yourself listening to the radio and thinking "hey, this is actually rather good" only to be disgusted when you found out it was the Sugar Babes?  Well this is why.  Sadly, the rest of the <em>Replicas</em> album (from which this song's taken) sounds like the soundtrack to Look Around You.  He soon lost favour with audiences, married a member of his fanclub, and called his children Raven, Persia and Echo.  'Nuf said...

P.S. if anyone can name both famous uses of the quote in this post's title, as well as the source from which it came, they'll get a prize!

*For the record, by "acoustic" i do <em>NOT</em> mean the Jack-Johnson-lite drivel that graced every middle-class family's coffee table a few years back.  I merely mean that it has acoustic instruments in it.  And Matt Costa can bugger off, an' all...
