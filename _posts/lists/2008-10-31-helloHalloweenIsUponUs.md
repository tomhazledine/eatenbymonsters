Tis a darn shame...).

So, while all the yuppies are boogying down to the strains of <em>The Monster Mash </em>and making out like they're yanks, and gangs of marauding hoodies go from door to door menacing old ladies for sweets, what is there for a discerning music fan to do?

Well, fear not kids, the answer is here. Gaze on my works, ye mighty, and despair! It the Wednesday Top Five (delayed on account of the All Hallows Even festivities):

The top 5 non-cheesy Hallween songs.

5: <strong><em>Halloween</em> by Dave Matthews &amp; Tim Reynolds</strong>.  Okay, okay; I know they're the least cool band in the world, but the <em>Dave Matthews Band</em> have actually made a couple of good records.  And besides, this doesn't really count as a DMB track, as this version comes from Dave &amp; Tim's <em>Live at Luther College</em> release.  It's properly angry (it very nearly made last week's list...) and good for scaring away unwanted kids from the door.  It does loose marks for unoriginal nomenclature, however...

4:<strong> <em>Hellhound </em>by Son Of Dave</strong>.  What with all the talk of crossroads etc, the devil surely listens to the blues.  And SoD uses the same loop pedal as I do, so I've got to love him.  For the love of god(sic) steer well clear of the <em>Jack on the Rocks</em> remix, though, as it's <em>truly</em> evil...

3: <strong><em>Frankenstein's Party of Three: Your Table is Ready</em> by Kelly Joe Phelps</strong>.  Here's some more blues, just for kicks.  Also likely to spark off some oh-so-interesting arguments about whether or not it was Frankenstein or Frankenstein's Monster that was the scary one...

2: <strong><em>This Devil's Workday</em> by Modest Mouse.</strong> Just plain creepy genius.  Jagged and nasty, like all the best MM songs.

1: <strong><em>Halloween</em> by Lupen Crook</strong>.  At times Lupen verges on sounding like a musical theatre act (erugh! I feel dirty even mentioning it...) but this track serves to remind us that Kurt Weill was actually quite good.  By far my favourite Halloween song, despite the lazy naming.
