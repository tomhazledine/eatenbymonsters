I've yet to see a 'band x for Christmas number one!' campaign this year, which I'm hoping is a good sign.  Last year was infested with them, all trying to cash in on the success of the Rage campaign the year before.  The whole business was intensely irritating and decidedly unchristmaslike.  With, however, one exception: [Christopher Dennis](http://christmas-sandwich.com/)' _The Christmas Sandwich_.  Originally written for his family in lieu of a present, last year Dennis and all his friends and family banded together, recorded [a nice video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQ9S05hT88), and attempted to top the X-mas charts.  I've yet to hear if they made it into the charts last christmas (which suggests they didn't) and their entire operation appears to have shut down for good on the 25th December last year, but nonsense-campaigns aside it is still a lovely song, and one that should be remembered.
