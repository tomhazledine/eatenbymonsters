It was the fantastic CD packaging that first drew me in to _Rest Now, Weary Head! You Will Get Well Soon_, an album by German singer-songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Konstantin Gropper, who trades under the _nom de plume_ [Get Well Soon](http://www.youwillgetwellsoon.com/).  Thankfully the music was of such a high quality that this album gets listened to on a semi-regular basis at EbM Towers.  This festive-themed track from that record serves nicely as an overview of Gropper's music generally, and if you want more he's just released a free live EP as a pre-tour X-mas present, which can be found [on his website](http://www.youwillgetwellsoon.com/konzerthaus/epeu.htm).
