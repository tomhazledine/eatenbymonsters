_[There's plenty of great Christmas songs out there, but most suffer terribly from over-exposure.  To remedy that, EbM presents a selection of [alternative Christmas songs](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/category/alternative-christmas/).]_

Greg Lake's I Believe in Father Christmas is one of the few 'proper' Christmas songs that I can still stand to listen to, but it just sounds too dated (and - like all 'big' Christmas songs - overexposed) to make this list.  Thankfully we have this up-to-date cover of it to see us through, performed by [Pictures of Then](http://picturesofthen.com/), and discovered through the _[XO For The Holidays](http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays4.html)_ compilation.  This version manages to quite effectively bring the air of menace and frustration - which was merely an undercurrent in the original - right into the foreground.
