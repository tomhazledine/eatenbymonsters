Well we've finally made it to the end, and it turns out these little single-song showcase posts have been quite popular; I'll have to do it again sometime.  Since Christmas is practically upon us now, I thought I'd better post what I consider to be the best Christmas song ever.  In fact, this little number from [The Very Foundation](http://theveryfoundation.com/) (courtesy of [XO for the Holidays](http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays4.html) 2009 comp.) is a song that ought to be an all-time-top-song of mine, but it's just so Christmasy that to listen to it outside of December would just feel wrong.  As it is, I savour the short time that I can get away with playing it on almost constant repeat.  Witty and at times ridiculous, yet always displaying a proper Christmas spirit (without ever descending into schmaltz), this is, in my view, the very best that Christmas music has to offer.

I hope all your days are merry and bright, and merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
