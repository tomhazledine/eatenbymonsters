This little number from [The Very Foundation](http://theveryfoundation.com/)Â (courtesy of [XO for the Holidays](http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays4.html) 2009 comp.) is a song that ought to be an all-time-top-song of mine, but it's just so Christmasy that to listen to it outside of December would just feel wrong. As it is, I savour the short time that I can get away with playing it on almost constant repeat. Witty and at times ridiculous, yet always displaying a proper Christmas spirit (without ever descending into schmaltz), this is, in my view, the very best that Christmas music has to offer.
