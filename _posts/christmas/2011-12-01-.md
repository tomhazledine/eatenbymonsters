A lot of my favourite Christmas tracks of recent years have come from the XO Publicity compilation records.  Volume IV can be downloaded for free, along with it's predecessors, [from the XO website](http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays.html). Not all of the tracks included are of equal quality, and some are just outright bad, but when they're good they're very, very good. Expect to see a few more tracks from those records in the EBM Christmas Archive, but before that treat yourselves to this sterling effort courtesy of [Master Slash Slave](http://www.myspace.com/master1slave). The band appears to be mostly the work of one man, Matt Jones. He has since disbanded the band, gotten married, and started a new project with his new wife, called [Jonesin'](http://www.myspace.com/jajonesin) (the new band's called that, not the wife). Anyway, the sentiments in this, the MSS Christmas effort, are ones I can empathise with totally (I'm looking at you, former band mates!).
