Way back in 2007 - before he'd even released his first album, _Falling Off The Lavender Bridge_Â - Dev Hynes, a.k.a. [Lightspeed Champion](http://www.lightspeedchampion.com/), built his reputation by releasing several home-recorded EPs. One of those was the creatively-titled _Garageband Xmas EP_, the two best tracks of which can be found at the bottom of this post.
