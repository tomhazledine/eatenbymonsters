Most of these Christmas picks are decidedly cheery, so who better to bring the mood down than EbM favourites [Frightened Rabbit](http://frightenedrabbit.com/)? There's a couple of versions of this little ditty kicking about the place - including one sung by a choir (minus lyrics, sadly; it's just humming) - but this one is my favourite. It's slightly tougher and less, well, smooth, and that's generally how I like my FR to sound. Â When reviewing [their 2011 EP](http://eatenbymonsters.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/a-frightened-rabbit-ep-frightened-rabbit/), I bemoaned the lack of producer Peter Katis' glossy presence, but in this instance the homemade rough-and-ready aspect works wonderfully.
