Although this little gem describes a scene totally alien to the cosy, insular, traditional English Christmas enjoyed at casa EbM, for some reason it struck a chord. Originally a Robert Earl Keen song, this version feels like it has more heart. I have, at best, a delicate relationship with country music, and the Keen version sounds a little too close to the dreaded Garth Brooks. This Ruth/Hull version can be found on Lindley's [bandcamp page](http://lindleyruth.bandcamp.com/). I'm sure you'll agree that the delivery in this one, tempered as it is by a female voice, turns the somewhat sinister edge of Keen's country drawl into an altogether more heart-warming affair (and the _Blue Christmas_ coda doesn't do any harm, either).
