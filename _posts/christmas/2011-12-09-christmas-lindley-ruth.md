I stumbled on this little gem quite recently, and although it describes a scene totally alien to the cosy, insular, traditional English Christmas enjoyed at casa EbM, but for some reason it struck a chord.  Originally a Robert Earl Keen song, this version feels like it has more heart.  I have, at best, a delicate relationship with country music, and the Keen version sounds a little too close to the dreaded Garth Brooks so beloved by my better half (plus I can't seem to find a version of the original that doesn't have [insufferably enthusiastic audience whoops on it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P37xPiRz1sg)).  This Ruth/Hull version can be found on her [bandcamp page](http://lindleyruth.bandcamp.com/), or via the link at the bottom of this post.  I'm sure you'll agree that the delivery in this one, tempered as it is by a female voice, turns the somewhat sinister edge of Keen's country drawl into an altogether more heart-warming affair (and the _Blue Christmas_ coda doesn't do any harm, either).
