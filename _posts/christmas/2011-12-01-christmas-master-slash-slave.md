[Master Slash Slave](http://www.myspace.com/master1slave) appears to be mostly the work of one man, Matt Jones. He has since disbanded the band, gotten married, and started a new project with his new wife, called [Jonesin'](http://www.myspace.com/jajonesin) (the new band's called that, not the wife). Anyway, the sentiments in this, the MSS Christmas effort, are ones I can empathise with totally (I'm looking at you, former band mates!).
