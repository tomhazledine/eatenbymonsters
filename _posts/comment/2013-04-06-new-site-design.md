miniDescription: Redesigning EbM again?! Surely not?
hasExcerpt: true
excerpt: <strong>Eaten by Monsters</strong> gets a makeover.

It's only been about five months since I switched this blog over from *Wordpress.com* to my own hosting, and since that heralded the first redesign of the site in its four-year history it probably seems a little soon to be changing the look of Eaten by Monsters yet again. The reasons for this new layout are partly aesthetic - my skills with **CSS** styling have come on leaps and bounds since the last redesign - but mostly this change is for functional reasons.

The switch to self-hosting meant that I could finally install proper *Google Analytics* and move away from the primary-colours feedback I could get through *Wordpress.com*. Seeing more realistic visitor figures was a shock, to be sure, and I finally realized exactly how much *Wordpress* had been sugar-coating my feedback stats. Mercifully the power of self-hosting meant I was able to make substantial changes to the architecture of this site at every level, and so the work began.

## The New Look

What you see on your screen now (as of April **2013**) are the fruits of my labours over the last few weeks. I've been furiously coding and trying my best to get to grips with concepts that were previously a mystery to me. This new site is faster, leaner, more semantic, and more search-engine-friendly. It's also, to a degree, more responsive. The design now reshuffles itself to best suit the resolution of the viewers screen, provided you're not using anything smaller than a **7"** tablet (go ahead, resize your browser and see for yourself).

There will, inevitably, be a few bugs and problems that crop up as the new design settles into place, but I intend to keep on top of them and keep disruption to a minimum. So please be forgiving if you encounter any 'page not found' errors, and if you're feeling really helpful you can drop me a line at \*tom at thisdomain\* to tell me about anything that's broken.
