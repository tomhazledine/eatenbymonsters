I know a decent proportion of you will have arrived here from *The Hype Machine* . Remixes seem quite popular there, so I'll bet a few of you are remix-connoisseurs. I just don't understand it myself.

Don't get me wrong; a good remix can be an enjoyable listening experience. Yet stumbling upon the mythic beast that is a "good remix" is uncommon. It seems to me that 99% of them are just plain rubbish.

## The Good Remix

In my eyes good remixes build on the foundation of a good track. They create a complimentary companion-piece to the original. Most of the *good* remixes I'm aware of can stand alone as musical works in their own right. But even with the good ones you're only getting half the picture.

To make a remix is to make a work that is inextricably tied to another; a musical Castor and Pollux. A good remix from a bad song can be interesting as an academic speculation. But without a solid foundation it is as redundant as a bad remix from a good song. This is where remixes differ from cover versions. A good cover version from a bad song can be a wondrous achievement.

Despite my misgivings, there are exponents of the "good remix". Many of my favourite acts have delivered sterling work in this field. In particular, **Four Tet**  (with **Kings of Convenience**) and **The Postal Service** (with **Feist**). My current favourite is the **Miyauchi Yuri** remix of _If He Breaks Your Heart_, by **Jeremy Warmsley**.

This remix undeniably butchers the harmonic content of the song by flattening it beyond belief. Here, though, it's defensible as a deliberate artistic choice. The sparse, angular substance of J-Wo's original acoustic version morphs into a lush soundscape. But despite this recrafting, the body of the song remains intact. It's a song with a definite arc and a "message"\*, and both remain in evidence in the remix. It retains the essence of the original whilst being a wholly new musical experience.

## The Bad Remix

Bad remixes are much thicker on the ground than good ones. The choices for a salient example were legion. **BbopNRokstedy** drew the short straw, as theirs was the most recent remix to land in my inbox. This one is a remix of **Phoenix's** track _1901_, who's parent album is excellent. 2009's _Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix_ is a bona fide triumph of a record. Alas we cannot say the same for the remix...

Here the relationship between original and remix is slender indeed. It appears **BbopNRokstedy** have hardly done any work at all. They've cut a couple of vocal snippets from *1901* and looped them over a godawful dance track. And that seems to be it! They've removed any trace of the original's structure or arc. That this outfit have the gall to call this abomination a "remix" beggars belief.

I realize I sound rather vitriolic at this point, but then that's why I'm writing. This kind of behaviour annoys me. I honestly enjoy listening to a good remix, but finding those good ones is too hard. The only sure-fire way to tell if a remix is going to be any good or not is to actually listen to the thing.

But of course there is a more sensible strategy; one that's guaranteed to work. If there's a 99% chance that a remix is going to terrible, I don't like those odds. The unavoidable conclusion is that it's far better to steer clear of remixes altogether.
