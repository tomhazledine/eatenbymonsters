intro: Not everyone loves Christmas songs, but I can't get enough of them. Every year we get the same old perennial hits, but most of these aren't as fulfilling as one might hope, musically speaking.

Never fear, help is at hand in the form of Eaten by Monsters' selection of the best alternative Christmas songs out there. I'm a real sucker for a good bit of seasonal merriment, and maybe you are too: my Christmas-related posts have always been inexplicably popular.

To keep you all happy, this page compiles the best of the "alternative" Christmas songs I've found.

While I love Christmas songs dearly, and there seem to be a awful lot of them out there, the number of them that are actually _good_ is sadly finite. This list is not comprehensive and nor is it definitive, but it represents the best I've heard to-date.
