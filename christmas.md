intro: Not everyone loves Christmas songs, but I can't get enough of them. Every year we get the same old perennial hits, but most of these aren't as fulfilling as one might hope, musically speaking.

asideToSortLater: All the songs on this list are at worst seasonally entertaining, and often pretty good regardless of the time of year, but the select few that follow have risen to a higher level. One benefit of a good Christmas song is that it is infinitely re-usable. At the core of this phenomenon is that at this time of year we're far more willing to be generous to songs that would, in other circumstances, sound dated or trashy. We'll throw caution and taste to the wind precisely because we know they'll be safely locked away again come december 24th. This next selection of songs, however, I wish I could listen to all year round (although, of course, I can't). The Withered Hand offering, in particular, represents the peak of an exceptional career.

Never fear, help is at hand in the form of Eaten by Monsters' selection of the best alternative Christmas songs out there. I'm a real sucker for a good bit of seasonal merriment, and maybe you are too: my Christmas-related posts have always been inexplicably popular.

To keep you all happy, this page compiles the best of the "alternative" Christmas songs I've found.

While I love Christmas songs dearly, and there seem to be a awful lot of them out there, the number of them that are actually _good_ is sadly finite. This list is not comprehensive and nor is it definitive, but it represents the best I've heard to-date.
