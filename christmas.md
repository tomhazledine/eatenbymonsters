intro: Not everyone loves Christmas songs, but I can't get enough of them. Every year we get the same old perennial hits, but most of these aren't as fulfilling as one might hope, musically speaking. Never fear, help is at hand in the form of Eaten by Monsters' selection of the best alternative Christmas songs out there.

Plenty of people despise Christmas music. I, for my sins, am not one of them. I'm a real sucker for a good bit of seasonal merriment,  and it seems so are a lot of you. Christmas-related posts are always popular, so I've decided to compile the best of the "alternative" Christmas songs I've found.

While I love Christmas songs dearly, and there seem to be a awful lot of them out there, the number of them that are actually _good_ is sadly finite. This list is not comprehensive and nor is it definitive, but it represents the best I've heard to-date.
